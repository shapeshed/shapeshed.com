## Inclusive New Media Design

I'm fortunate to be taking part in a study at the [University of East
London][1]. [Inclusive New Media Design][2] is seeking to identify the best ways
to encourage developers to build websites to support people with intellectual
disabilities. The project has welcomed speakers who have shared their knowledge
of this area. As part of the project we have built a small social networking
application for intellectually disabled users called iBrow. The idea came from
[Lisa Haskell ][3] and has been developed by Alex Beech and me. Although the
application is at a very alpha stage we got the chance to test it with a range
of intellectually disabled users. The application allows users to enter 10 of
their favorite things and then returns photos from Flickr's API. If there are
other users in the application with the same favorites it will show them. The
idea is that it will help users to find friends with similar interests to them
and make friendships.

## What we learnt

Firstly we learnt that the people who came to test were first and foremost
people. They were funny, interesting and engaging. The users responded very well
to our little application and as a proof of concept it worked very well.

We learnt that the users had a range of ability and experience with the
internet. Some were comfortable using a keyboard whilst others were not. Some
used switches, some used touch screens. Some found small text hard to read
whilst others found reading anything very difficult. After a couple of minutes
it became clear to me that Intellectual Disability is not a homogenous term and
that there are a broad range of abilities and conditions within this term. It
would seem there are a common set of techniques that you can use to improve
sites for ID users and it would be great if we can iterate and test these
assumptions.

## More work to be done

The next session for the research project is in May and we hope to do some
further testing to try and come up with some assumptions and even
recommendations for intellectually disabled users. WCAG 1.0 doesn't really
mention ID users and WCAG 2.0 touches on this user group lightly. Working with
Intellectually Disabled users has shown me that they are very capable of using
the internet and that it can make a huge difference to their lives. Let's hope
that we can share the knowledge we gain from this project as we continue to
understand how ID users interact with the web.
