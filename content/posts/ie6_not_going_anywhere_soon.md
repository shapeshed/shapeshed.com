## The Sample

To perform the analysis I took data from two well know City of London firms. I
wanted to assess IE6 usage within the corporate sector. I used Google analytics
to complete this analysis. I wanted to see the effect of the [Microsoft auto
update][1] to IE7 on February 12th was. Admittedly this a very small sample but
I know that site visitors come from corporate environments. For this blog around
31% of visitors use IE and of that only 35% use IE6. I know that is not
indicative of most of my clients so hence the analysis.

## Findings

Firstly Internet Explorer is the dominant browser in the corporate environment.
For the three month period IE dominates with around 88% of the market. This was
much higher than I had expected.

Secondly Internet Explorer 6 accounts for around half of the visitors. In three
months IE6 has dropped from 53% to 49% and this has switched straight to IE7
which has risen from 35% to 39%.

## Conclusion

For corporate clients at least it seems that IE6 is going to be with us for a
while. For this sample it seems that the forced update of IE7 has had no
noticeable effect on browser usage. The 4% shift to IE7 can probably be
accounted for from upgrades to Vista. For corporate clients it seems we will
need to continue supporting IE6 for a while yet. I wonder what other people's
experience of the results of the forced update are?
