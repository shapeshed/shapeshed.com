## A key-value store and more

The 2.0.0 release of Redis is out and offers a super-fast key value store that
stores data in-memory. It offers a persistent data store along with support for
sets, string values and hashes. Performance wise it is [extremely][1] [fast][7]
and offers replication without too much fuss. As a developer it is a joy to use.
On OSX you can install it using homebrew:

```sh
brew install redis
```

and then start the server with

```sh
redis-server
```

Now you can connect to it with a client and start adding and retrieving data
with a client

```sh
redis-cli
```

## Basics

Here's a basic example of setting and getting a value

```sh
redis> set favorite_drink gin
OK
redis> get favorite_drink
"gin"
```

Once you have a value you can get information from Redis as to its type:

```sh
redis> type favorite_drink
string
```

And whether a key exists

```sh
redis> exists favorite_drink
(integer) 1
```

I'll cover more of the excellent features in subsequent posts.

## Using Ruby and Redis

Redis has wrappers for most lanugages including Ruby, Python and PHP. For Ruby
you can install the wrapper with

```sh
sudo gem install redis
```

You can then use it in scripts with

```ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'redis'

redis = Redis.new
redis.set "foo", "bar"
```

## Great for caches and counters

Redis is great for things like counters. Say for example you want to track the
number of times a page has been viewed. This is simple with Redis:

```sh
redis.incr "views"
=> 1
redis.incr "views"
=> 2
```

For non-persistent data like caching it is a really good solution too. You can
even use it as the [cache in Rack applications.][3]
