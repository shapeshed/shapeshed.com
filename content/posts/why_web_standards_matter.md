## The problem

The Internet is growing very quickly. New platforms, technologies and browsers
are emerging all the time. With so much innovation going on there is a real
danger that a plethora of platforms and technologies will leave web development
behind. In short the web is becoming more complex and less standardised.

## A simple solution

Thankfully as early as 1994 this problem was identified and the World Wide Web
Consortium emerged. W3C, as it is more commonly known, promotes common protocols
for web developers to follow.

## What does this mean for clients?

Most clients are understandably not interested in the latest developments. But
new media managers and those responsible for internet content should ensure that
websites are compliant with International Standards. Valid code is relatively
simple to achieve and has numerous benefits.

## Benefits for clients

1. **Valid code is search engine friendly.** Search engine spiders are built to
   read sites by scanning code. If the code is invalid there is a danger the
   spider will not read your site. This can have dire consequences for your site
   ranking. Valid code results in better, more consistent rankings. You will
   find that you may not have to engage in search engine optimisation at all if
   you have valid code.
2. **Valid code displays consistently** The Internet has a myriad of different
   operating systems and browsers. Almost all of them will display valid code in
   a consistent manner. Coupled with some design principles this means your site
   will work and display correctly wherever or whoever is using it.
3. **Valid code is more extensible than invalid code.** In short the overheads
   and time needed to update a site or to move it to a new platform is less.
   Valid code helps to future proof a website.
4. **Valid code is more accessible than invalid code.** In the UK, the
   Disability Discrimination Act stipulates that websites should be usable by
   disabled users. Valid code is an integral part of making a website
   accessible.
5. **Valid code is good quality control** Validation is part of our commitment
   to quality. Our clients are entitled to expect their website to work and
   function correctly across a range of platforms and browsers. It is our
   responsibility to ensure this occurs. Our commitment to valid code is part of
   our quality assurance process.
