+++

To apply an icon to links in CSS you use background-image. Although you should
use icons on links sparingly icons can greatly improve the usability of a site.
In this example we have a link that goes to a journal entry page. Make an icon
using Illustrator, Photoshop or your favorite imaging software. Make sure that
it relates well to the size of the text it appears next to. Here I've made a
simple pencil: ![Pencil icon][1]

## The Markup

In this example we have a simple link within a div

```html
<div id="example-link">
  <a href="#">Link to journal article</a>
</div>
```

## The CSS

```css
#example-link a {
  padding-left: 15px;
  background: url(/images/examples/bglinks/pencil_icon.gif) 3px 1px no-repeat;
}
```

## Explanation:

Padding left - This moves the text away from the image. Depending on the width
of your image you will need more or less padding

Background - This has the rules associated with the the background image

- url(/images/examples/bglinks/pencil_icon.gif) - This is the path the image you
  want to be your icon.
- 3px 1px - These values position the background image. The first value is the
  background image's distance from the left of the a tag, the second is the
  distance from the top of the a tag.
- No-repeat tells the browser only to show the image once.

## The code in action
