## How much charge do we have?

With the HTML5 Battery Status API you can gain access to battery information for
the host machine of the browser you are using. The uses for this might be to
reduce operations that use battery life in your application if the battery is
low or show battery graphics. You can get access to battery information through
`navigator.battery`. Particularly for mobile devices I can see this being really
useful.

This returns a JavaScript object with battery status information.

```javascript
navigator.battery

{
  charging: true,
  chargingTime: 0,
  dischargingTime: Infinity,
  level: 1,
  onchargingchange: null,
  onchargingtimechage: null,
  ondischargingtimechange: null,
  onlevelchange: null
}
```

You will notice a number of events that you can bind to

```javascript
navigator.battery.onchargingchange = function () {
  console.log(navigator.battery.charging);
};

navigator.battery.onchargingtimechange = function () {
  console.log(navigator.battery.chargingTime);
};

navigator.battery.oncdischargingtimechange = function () {
  console.log(navigator.battery.dischargingTime);
};

navigator.battery.onlevelchange = function () {
  console.log(navigator.battery.level);
};
```

You could use these to update graphics or change application behaviour when
battery life or status changes.

## Browser support

At the time of writing the Battery Status API is candidate recommendation but my
experience of browser support is poor. I wasn't able to find much information on
the status of this API. In my current version of Chromium (31.0.1650.63) it is
unsupported either as `navigator.battery` or `navigator.webkitBattery`. I found
that my version of Firefox (26.0) is supported but only default values are
returned so the browser isn't able to read battery status.
