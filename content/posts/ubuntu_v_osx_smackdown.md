## Round one - Appearance

You might acuse me of being a design luvvie, but how a platform looks and feels
is important to me. I stare at it for at least 8 hours a day. On initial install
Ubuntu fares pretty badly. The fonts, especially when viewing a website are
awful and make reading anything painful. The overall look and feel is acceptable
and noticeably quicker than OSX, even running under [Parallels][1].

There's a number of tips to improve fonts on Ubuntu including [enabling smooth
font rendering][2] and [installing further fonts][3]. After completing this the
rendering is excellent especially with the additional tips for a laptop monitor.

As expected though it is not as slick as OSX and the fact that you have to spend
a couple of hours customising the display and fonts, including fiddling with the
command line means OSX wins this round.

![Ubuntu Look and Feel][4]

**Score: OSX 1 Ubuntu 0**

## Round two - Text editor

I edit code a lot. [Textmate][5] has been a real productivity help for me with
the excellent support for snippets and integration with version control systems.
In fact I'd go as far to say that I love Textmate. So when I was testing Ubuntu
I basically wanted Textmate in Ubuntu. It turns out that by [using a few of the
supplied plugins][6] with [gedit][7] you can have snippets, colour formatting,
easy file browsing \*and\* Terminal.

This is a real win for me. I'm a heavy terminal user so the fact that it is
right there in the editor is great. For me to award the points to gedit in this
round is a biggie as I'm a massive Textmate fan, but Terminal integration swings
it.

![gedit][8]

**Score: OSX 1 Ubuntu 1**

## Round three - Email client

I'm almost at the stage of moving my email client to the browser but not quite.
Mail.app is my choice on OSX and it has served me well. The default Mail client
on Ubuntu is [Evolution][9]. After a quick play with Evolution I wasn't
immediately impressed so opted for [Thunderbird][10]. Before moving to OSX three
years ago I was a heavy Thunderbird user.

Thunderbird works for me. The user interface is clean and IMAP setup for my
Google Hosted email was straightforward. Given that we have already given the
Look and Feel round to OSX, there is nothing functionality wise that Thunderbird
loses on. So round three goes to Ubuntu.

![Thunderbird][11]

**Score OSX 1 Ubuntu 2**

## Round four - Browser

Perhaps it is a little unfair on Ubuntu but Apple have just released [Safari
4][12] and from a UI and performance viewpoint it is great. With Ubuntu you get
[Firefox][13] which is a good browser and I have no complaints about. Of course
for development Firefox has a wealth of plugins so that is a quick jab back in
Safari's direction. Overall though just for the massively improved UI Safari
wins.

![Firefox][14]

**Score OSX 2 Ubuntu 2**

## Round five - Music player

This is the round where Ubuntu has to go and have a pep talk from the trainer in
the corner. [Rhythmbox][15] can't compare to iTunes, plain and simple. I also
tried [Songbird][16] which looks promising but still doesn't quite cut it.
Rhythmbox has some nice features like [Last.fm][17] integration but there's a
way to go yet.

![Rhythmbox][18]

**Score OSX 3 Ubuntu 2**

## Round six - Twitter client

Clearly the talk with the trainer didn't do Ubuntu any good. Unless you want to
install Adobe AIR (no thanks) you are a bit stuffed. [gTwitter][19] is your
pretty much your only option. Coming from [Twitterific][20] on OSX the
experience is not the same. Perhaps Twitter isn't the most important part of
your working day, but I'm an avid user and use it heavily to keep up to date
with friends and happenings. So another clear win for OSX.

![gTwitter][21]

**Score OSX 4 Ubuntu 2**

## Round seven - Office applications

Although I'm not a heavy user of Office applications clients do send through
contracts and content in a variety of formats. I've toyed with [Google
Documents][22] and use that for some of my work-flow but mostly I'm using
Apple's [iWork suite][23] at the moment. Basically I think iWork is poor. Pages
is clunky and Numbers doesn't impress me. Keynote is probably the best of the
applications in the suite. Ubuntu ships with [Open Office][24] with which I have
had a terrible experience with in the past. On initial tests though it has
improved a great deal. Open Office is much snappier than iWork and mainly
because iWork is so poor Ubuntu wins.

**Score OSX 4 Ubuntu 3**

## Round eight - FTP client

Even though I often use the command line to move files around I still use a GUI
FTP client heavily. On OSX I have the excellent [Transmit][25]. On Ubuntu there
are a few options but I tried [gFTP][26]. Functionally it is fast, very fast. It
wins hands down on that front. In terms of the UI though it is clunky and a long
way from Transmit.

![gftp][27]

**Score OSX 5 Ubuntu 3**

## Round nine - Workspaces

Setting up different workspaces that you can quickly switch between is a great
productivity boost. Apple introduced [Spaces][28] in OSX Leopard. I've really
want to use Spaces and I've tried on several different occassions but the
switching between desktops is clunky and my experience is that several apps
don't play nice with it. Basically it has never worked smoothly for me.

Ubuntu has the ability to switch spaces in the bottom right hand corner of the
screen. You can right click and customise it pretty much how you like and have
up to 32 spaces. In my limited use it is intuitive and works without problems. A
win for Ubuntu.

**Score OSX 5 Ubuntu 4**

## And the winner is..

- Insert scantily clad women here \*

... OSX. Granted my assessment criteria is very bespoke to me. For my daily
development work my assessment is that Ubuntu would serve me well and I don't
think it is that far behind. Note I didn't mention design apps here - Adobe has
the market sewn up (that's another story) so I need OSX for this.

I'm not going to be dumping OSX just yet but I've been really impressed with the
amount that you can customise Ubuntu. If you are comfortable searching for
solutions to your problems then you can pretty much do or get anything with
Ubuntu (that's the power of Linux). If you like things to 'just work' then you
are probably better off sticking with OSX for now.
