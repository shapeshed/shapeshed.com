## No shorthand method

The [`ioutil`][1] package offers some of the common operations needed when
working with files but nothing for copying files. Go tries to keep things
lightweight so as operations become more complex the [`os`][2] package should be
used. The `os` package operates at a slightly lower level and as such expects
that files are explicitly closed after opening them. Reading the source code of
the `os` package shows that many of the functions in the `ioutil` package are
wrappers around the `os` package and remove the requirements to explicitly close
files.

## Copying a file

To copy a file is therefore a case of glueing together a few functions from the
`os` package. The process is

- Open the file that should be copied
- Read the contents
- Create and open the file that the contents should be copied into
- Write to the new file
- Close both files

## Code example

The following shows an example of copying a file in Go.

```go
package main

import (
  "io"
  "log"
  "os"
)

func main() {
  from, err := os.Open("./sourcefile.txt")
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
  defer from.Close()

  to, err := os.OpenFile("./sourcefile.copy.txt", os.O_RDWR|os.O_CREATE, 0666)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
  defer to.Close()

  _, err = io.Copy(to, from)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
}

```

## Code example explaination

The code example can be explained as follows.

- The `Open` function from the `os` module is used to read a file from disk.
- A defer statement is used to close the file once the script has finished all
  other execution.
- The `OpenFile` function is used to open a file. The first argument is the name
  of the file to be opened or created if it does not exist. The second argument
  represents the flags to be used on the file. In this case it is read and write
  and should be created if it does not exist. Finally the permissions on the
  file are set.
- Another defer statement is used to close this file after other execution has
  finished.
- The `Copy` function is then used from the `io` package. This copies from the
  source file and writes it to the destination.
