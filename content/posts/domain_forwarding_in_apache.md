## The disclaimer bit

First of all this tutorial is based on Apache 2.2 on Centos 5. No responsibility
will be taken for things going wrong so use at your own risk!

## What we want to achieve

Let's say we have a client who wants to forward three domains to one. For this
example let's use:

- www.ilovemymonkeys.com
- www.monkeysarecool.com
- www.monkeysrockmyworld.com

The domain the client wants all of these forwarded to is

- www.monkeyworld.com

## Is it really worth it?

Well not really no. If you can persuade the client it is probably best to park
these additional domains that have been registered. There is not going to be a
great deal of benefit, if any, for SEO. But if you really need to do it here's
how.

## What you'll need

This article assumes you have command line access to your box. If you don't then
you'll need to contact your hosting company and explain your requirements

## Virtual hosts

It is likely you'll be using [Name Based Virtual Hosts][1] in Apache. If you
haven't set up Virtual Hosts it is a great way to manage sites so be sure to
read up on it. Presuming you have an entry for `monkeyworld.com` we need to
edit/create it in our virtual hosts file. The location of where you should place
this varies depending on what flavour of Linux you are running. On Centos 5 you
can create a file in `/etc/httpd/conf.d` with the appendix .conf and it will be
picked up when Apache is started.

```sh
vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/httpd-vhosts.conf
```

Edit the file as follows.

```apache
NameVirtualHost *:80
# Monkey World
<VirtualHost *:80>
  <Directory /var/www/vhosts/monkeysarecool.com/httpdocs>
    AllowOverride All
  </Directory>
    DocumentRoot /var/www/vhosts/monkeysarecool.com/httpdocs
    ServerName www.monkeysarecool.com
    ServerAlias ilovemonkeys.com monkeysarecool.co.uk monkeysrockmyworld.co.uk
    ServerAlias www.ilovemonkeys.com www.monkeysarecool.co.uk www.monkeysrockmyworld.co.uk
    Include /var/www/vhosts/monkeysarecool.com/conf/vhost.conf
</VirtualHost>
```

You'll see the lines Server Alias have listings for the domains both with `www`
and without. This ensures you can receive requests with and without `www`. I
like to put them on separate lines so I can see I have what's happening.

Finally there is an Include line. This points to an additional configuration
file for the domain. You could use an `.htaccess` file here but if you have root
access to the box it is much more efficient performance wise to put it in an
additional configuration file.

## Forwarding the domain

So far we've set up requests for Apache to serve up `monkeyworld.com` for our
additional domains. You could leave it like this and restart Apache to have the
same content served up on these domains. This is a bad thing for Google though
and it is likely your rankings will slip down with duplicate content on multiple
domains.

So we want to forward the domain. To do that lets open our additional
configuration file:

```sh
vi /var/www/vhosts/monkeysarecool.com/conf/vhost.conf
```

Edit the file as follows.

```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(monkeyworld.com|ilovemonkeys.com|monkeysarecool.co.uk|monkeysrockmyworld.co.uk) [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.monkeyworld.com$1 [R=301,L]

RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(www.ilovemonkeys.com|www.monkeysarecool.co.uk|www.monkeysrockmyworld.co.uk) [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.monkeyworld.com$1 [R=301,L]
```

We're using Apache's [mod_rewrite][2] to send redirect requests and return a 301
Moved Permanently Header. This should help Google and any other bots to
understand what we're doing. Again I like separate entries for with and without
`www` but that's personal preference.

Save this file. We should be done but before restarting Apache let's test that
we haven't made any syntax errors that will stop the server from starting up.

```sh
/etc/init.d/httpd configtest
```

If you get "Syntax OK" you are good to restart the server:

```sh
/etc/init.d/httpd restart
```

All done! So now when you hit `www.ilovemonkeys.com`, `monkeysarecool.co.uk` or
`monkeysrockmyworld.co.uk` you will be forwarded `www.monkeyworld.com`, with the
address being changed as well.
