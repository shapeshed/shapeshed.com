## Everyone knows web typography is lacking

I am not the first to notice that Typography on the web is generally terrible.
Many designers overlook the importance of Typography and leave text at default
settings, using the safe but not so inspiring Arial. Textual layout is often an
afterthought. Reading
<a href="/journal/elements_of_typographic_style_bringhurst/">Bringhurst's</a>
book I realised there is an entire craft that is generally being overlooked.
Devoting time to typography is an essential part of design and moreover
legibility. Usability is rightly being seen as a key driver for successful
websites, so whey isn't typography being mentioned more often?

## CSS does allow text to be styled extensively

Reading the CSS 2.1 Spec I rediscovered some properties that had been pushed
aside because there I thought (wrongly) that there were cross browser issues.
There are some properties that are not well supported but there are many that
have excellent support and are, in my opinion, being underused. With some sound
knowledge of CSS and XHTML there is no reason why typographic layouts should be
limited to default settings.

The following properties are cross browser friendly for example:

- [text-indent][1]
- [text-align][2]
- [letter-spacing][3]
- [word-spacing][3]
- [text-transform][4]
- [first-letter][5]
- [line-height][6]

Have a look at [the example page][7] to see these properties in action

Granted typography on the web is not an easy environment to operate in. There
are a limited number of fonts available, browser support for some
typography-related CSS is poor. But after reading the spec and testing a few
properties I felt empowered rather than depressed.

## A resolution

I'm resolved to improve my typography after reading Bringhurst's book and the
work of a couple of pioneers in Richard Rutter and Mark Boulton. I hope others
will follow and help improve typography on the web.
