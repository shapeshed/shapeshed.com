## What is the ln command in UNIX?

The `ln` command is a command line utility for making links between files. It
supports creating a hard and symbolic links to data on disk.

## What is the difference between a hard and symbolic link?

To understand the difference between a hard and symbolic link it is important to
first understand the relationship between a file and data on disk. When a file
is created the filename connects a file system with bytes that have been written
to disk. When a file is removed the data on disk remains but the file system has
no way of accessing it.

A hard link is a direct link to the data on disk. This means data can be
accessed directly via an original filename or a hard link. Both the original
file and the hard link are direct links to the data on disk. The use of a hard
link allows multiple filenames to be associated with the same data on disk.

A symbolic link (also sometimes known as a soft link) does not link directly to
the data on disk but to another link to the data on disk. On most operating
systems folders may only be linked using a symlink. Symbolic links can link
across file systems to link a folder on an external hard drive.

## How to create a hard link

To create a hard link using the `ln` command pass the full path of the target
file and the link name. This has the effect of creating a new file that links to
the same data on disk as the target file. In the following example `target.txt`
is linked to via `link.txt`.

```sh
ls
cat target.txt
target file
ln target.txt link.txt
ls
target.txt link.txt
cat link.txt
target file
```

Editing `link.txt` has the effect of changing the underlying data on disk. The
files `link.txt` and `target.txt` are therefore equivalent.

```sh
echo "link edit" >> link.txt
cat target.txt
target file
link edit
```

## How to create a hard link in the current directory

To create a hard link in the current directory to a target file pass the path of
the file or folder. This will create a hard link to the target file.

```sh
tree
.
└── foo
    └── bar.txt
1 directory, 1 file
```

```sh
ln foo/bar.txt
tree
.
├── bar.txt
└── foo
    └── bar.txt
1 directory, 2 files
```

## How to create a symbolic link

To create a symbolic link pass the `-s` option to the `ln` command followed by
the target file and the name of link. In the following example a file is
symlinked into the `bin` folder.

```sh
ln -s ~/code/notes/notes ~/bin/notes
ls -l ~/bin/ | grep notes
lrwxrwxrwx 1 george users   29 Oct  7 10:07 notes -> /home/george/code/notes/notes
```

In the following example a mounted external drive is symlinked into a home
directory. This allows for convenient browsing of the external drive within the
home directory.

```sh
ln -s /mnt/external-drive ~/mydrive
```

If the hard drive is unmounted the symlink in the home directory will still be
present. This scenario is a broken symlink.

```sh
cd ~/mydrive
cd: no such file or directory mydrive
```
