## Built on open source software

Google Chrome uses WebKit the rendering engine that powers Safari. This is
perhaps surprising given that Google funds [around 85%][1] of Mozilla's Firefox
revenue. Quite why Chrome does not use the Gecko rendering engine isn't made
explicit, but I suspect memory usage was the reason. Google have also [open
sourced][2] Chrome. This is a definite strength of the project and it is
encouraging to see Google's approach in releasing this software.

## Performance

There is one feature that has obviously received a great deal of attention -
performance. For modern JavaScript intensive websites this is a breath of fresh
air. Who owns the biggest JavaScript intensive websites? Google of course. Using
[GMail][3] or [Google Reader is ][4] impressively fast. In fact you might go as
far as to say that this browser was designed for just these kind of sites and it
shows.

Jon Resig has completed as [series of performance tests][5] on the JavaScript
engine concluding that this is fantastic news for users and application
developers.

## Chrome's UI

It was reasonably predictable that Chrome should work very well but not really
get the heart racing on the design front. [Jon Hicks noted][6] that it looks
like a Fisher Price Browser. I agree that it does have the ring of "My First
Browser", but as you use Chrome there are some very nice touches. Contextual
elements like the Status Bar, that only appears when it is relevant. I've long
thought that Browser UI could use contextual elements more and this is a great
little feature.

![Chrome's Contextual Status][7]

The ability to search directly in the address bar is nothing new - you can do
this in Opera, but nonetheless it is an excellent feature. It reduces the
clutter from the UI and is an elegant solution.

The most visted feature is something that seems to have been largely inspired by
Opera, and many like [Ben Ward][9] have expressed frustration that Google has
claimed this as as innovation. Regardless of credit for the innovation it is a
great feature and is of real value to the user.

The UI as a whole is disappointing but it works. Function has triumphed over
form. This is consistent with Google's design approach and it would seem to be a
design philosophy that is working. I can accept the argument that a browser
should be largely invisible and if people do not notice it then it has entirely
succeeded. I would have liked a bit more excitement though!

## Internet Explorer 8

Let's not forget that [Internet Explorer 8][11] is just around the corner. To
date, a bizarre market has emerged in desktop computing where the worst product
has the biggest market share. Because Internet Explorer is tethered to Windows
it has been the market leader for quite some time. [Firefox][12] has steadily
chipped away at this market share as users have realised that Firefox offers
greater stability, security and performance. Others like [Opera][13] have
continued to produce excellent products but lacked penetration.

The release of Chrome must be hugely demoralising for the IE8 team who are
working hard to get up to speed with the rest of the market. The initial betas
have been encouraging but it would seem that Microsoft just cannot compete with
the speed of open source projects and now Google's Chrome. I have stated before
that I am not anti-Microsoft - I would just like to see the best product have
the biggest market share. I hope the release of Chrome will allow the browser
market to become more transparent and let users understand they have a choice in
the browser that they use. By all accounts Google is already seeing a good
uptake even during Beta.

## Conclusion

Chrome is a positive step forward for the average user's experience of the
internet. If users can experience the web in a safer, faster way and developers
have more opportunities to build bigger and better applications based on open
standards then it can only be a good thing. What I am really looking for though
is a fix for the browser market in general. It makes me deeply uneasy that
Internet Explorer has such large market share when it is an underperforming
product. If Google's Chrome can go some way to resolving this paradox I for one
welcome its arrival.
