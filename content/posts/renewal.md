Mist envelops the soft hills,\
Smothering the quiet, monochromatic hues.\
I watch life evaporating from the leaves,\
As they prepare to fall, and end this cycle.

Dark, lifeless days are to come,\
As coldness enters my bones.\
My breath will illuminate the air,\
Exhaling a time that is gone.

Storms will arrive and shake the earth.\
Lashing grey doors and smoking chimneys.\
They will twist this broken soul,\
Crashing high seas into indelible memories.

But slowly and and with certainly,\
The aching winds will yield to warmth.\
Buds will push over bleeding sap,\
And beautiful, verdant life will return.
