## Structure content

Structuring your content is a general practice that applies to all emails. Place
the most important message at the top of the email so readers can see what you
are trying to communicate within the first few sentences. Readers often spend
only a few seconds reading an email so get your message at the top and support
the message with further content below.

## Page sections

Dividing your text only email into sections is a good way of breaking up the
communication. Although text only does not allow styling you still have a number
of characters to divide the page up.

```sh
=======================================================
Section 1
=======================================================
Magnus es, domine, et laudabilis valde: magna virtus tua, et
sapientiae tuae non est numerus. Et laudare te vult homo, aliqua
portio creaturae tuae, et homo circumferens mortalitem suam,
circumferens testimonium peccati sui et testimonium.

=======================================================
Section 2
=======================================================
Magnus es, domine, et laudabilis valde: magna virtus tua,
et sapientiae tuae non est numerus. et laudare te vult homo,
aliqua portio creaturae tuae, et homo circumferens mortalitem
suam, circumferens testimonium peccati sui et testimonium.

## Use lists

You can still use lists in text only emails. A convention is to use asterisks.

```sh
You should be happy because:
* You have cake
* You have tea
* You have a job
```

## Put links on a new line

Text only links will often be converted to blue links in many email clients. For
email clients that do not convert links it is a good practice to put links on a
new line if possible. This allows reader to see the link clearly and to follow
it if they wish. If the link is not on a new line it can get lost in the other
content.

```sh
Taudare te vult homo, aliqua portio creaturae tuae, et
circumferens testimonium peccati sui et testimonium.

```

## Calls to action

You can still use calls to action in emails with punchy messages followed by
links.

```sh

## Keep it short

A common mistake is simply to have too much content. Readers simply won't read
long text. Keep your message short and to the point. If your content is too long
edit it. If you cannot edit it consider breaking the message into more than one
email or providing extended information via a PDF download.
