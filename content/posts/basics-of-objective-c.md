## Objective-C 101

The second Stanford iPhone development course assignment focusses on
understanding more Objective-C. At the time of writing the PDF is still
available from the [Stanford CS193P][1] website.

## A simple command line script

The assignment is to create a simple command line script to make an introduction
to Objective-C.

The first thing that was a little bit different for me was understanding main
which basically functions a bit like a constructor class in PHP (excuse my
Objective-C ignorance if this is totally wrong). Objective C is also upside down
from what I'm used to so main comes at the end.

```objective-c
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
- void PrintPathInfo() {
  // Code from path info section here
}
int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {
  NSAutoreleasepool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];
  PrintPathInfo();
  PrintProcessInfo();
  PrintBookmarkInfo();
  PrintIntrospectionInfo();
```

Syntax is more verbose from say Ruby so declaring a string is

```objective-c
NSString *path = @"~";
```

instead of

```objective-c
path = "~"
```

The whole NS thing relates to [NeXTSTEP][2], an operating system that Apple
bought back in the day. The NS prefix has stuck around (I'm not really sure why)
so pretty NS is everywhere in Objective C - NSLog, NSAutoreleasepool etc.

## Creating the project

I'm on the iPhone 4.0 SDK and the menus had moved around a bit. To create a
Foundation Command Line Tool go to Mac OSX > Application > Command Line tool and
then select Foundation from the Type dropdown.

![Creating a Foundation Command Line Tool][3]

When you run the application you want the console up so you can see what's
happening. You can access this via Run > Console

## Working through the tasks

There are four tasks in the assignment which relate to the functions in the code
above. I found the following documentation really useful in understanding the
requirements:

- [NSString documentation][4], especially [stringByExpandingTildeInPath][5] for
  the first task.
- [NSProcessInfo documentation][6] for the second task
- [NSMutableDictionary][7] for the third task
- [NSObject Protocol Reference][8] for the final task especially
  [isMemberOfClass][9], [isKindOfClass][10], [respondsToSelector][11] and
  [conformToProtocol][12]

## Outputting to the console

The task isn't sexy but helped me to understand Objective-C a lot more

## Source code

I've made the source code for my working through the examples available on
[Github][14]. Bear in mind I'm starting out so I'm not suggesting this is best
practice code.
