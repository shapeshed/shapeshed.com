## The problem

To begin working on a Rails app I need to do things like starting a server,
starting a console, ensure background processes are running, start a terminal
window so I can watch logs, start a text editor etc etc.

Doing all this is tedious. Wouldn't it be nice if we could just do something
like?

```sh
start_myapp
```

Well you can!

## Tmux

[Tmux][2] is a 'terminal multiplexer'. What the hell's that? It basially allows
you to create terminal sessions - similar to [GNU Screen][3] where you can
detach from a session and come back later. If you are not familiar with tmux
there are a few good resources available

- [A quick tmux (terminal multiplexer) screencast (a better GNU screen)][4]
- [Love, hate, & tmux][5]
- [TMUX - The Terminal Multiplexer (Part 1)][6]
- [TMUX - The Terminal Multiplexer (Part 2)][7]

You can install tmux with homebrew

```sh
brew install tmux
```

It takes a little reading and configuring but is well worth effort if you are a
heavy terminal user.

## Tmuxinator

[Tmuxinator][8] is an excellent gem that lets you define the layouts of your
tmux sessions.

You can install tmuxinator from RubyGems

```sh
gem install tmuxinator
```

By defining a yaml file we can layout things exactly how we want them.

```yaml
project_name: myapp
project_root: ~/Sites/myapp
tabs:
  - zsh:
  - vim: vim .
  - foreman: bundle exec foreman start
  - git: git pull
  - console: bundle exec rails console
  - server: bundle exec rails server
  - logs: tail -f log/development.log
```

Then you can start your session with `start_myapp` and your layout will be ready
for you. Here's a screenshot from the documentation:

![Tmux session][13]

There's excellent documentation on using tmuxinator in the [project README][9]

## Foreman

Enter the final piece of the jigsaw - [foreman][10]. Foreman is a gem that lets
you manage background processes associated with your application through a
Procfile. You just add any processes you want to be started into the Procfile
and you are done. Here's an example

```yaml
worker: bundle exec rake resque:work QUEUE=sweep_orders
apn_sender: bundle exec rake apn:sender
resque_scheduler: bundle exec rake resque:scheduler
resque_web:
  bundle exec resque-web --foreground --server thin --port $PORT --no-launch
sphinx: bundle exec rake ts:run_in_foreground
```

You can then start these process by running

```sh
foreman start
```

The processes will run in the foreground and spit out any logs messages to
standard output - perfect for development.

Using foreman you can add a tab to tmuxinator that will start your processes and
have a nice log of what they are doing. We have a neat way of starting any
background processes in our app within the context of our unified tmux
development environment.

So with one command we can set things up exactly the way we want and get
straight into developing.

## Alternatives

This technique will also work well for screen and regular terminal users with
the [Screeninator][11] and [Terminitor][12] gems so if you are not sold on tmux
you can still use it.
