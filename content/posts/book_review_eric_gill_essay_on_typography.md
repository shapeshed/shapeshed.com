Gill begins his books with a chapter entitled "Time and Place". This chapter is
more about culture in general than typography. The chapter compares
Industrialism to traditional crafts, noting the two are completely different and
that one is largely bereft of humanity whilst the other embodies it. The chapter
largely deals with the idea that design must now work for machines to mass
reproduce rather than just one artisan producing unique works. Gill's concern is
that humanity is lost in this exercise. This chapter can be applied to the web
in many ways - making a website human and usable by humans is still a major
challenge that faces designers today. Technology does not solve everything -
humanity is just as important.

Gill goes on to talk about how Typography has progressed through time, moving
from hand driven typography to mass printing presses. Each is examined for the
impact on the craft with very interesting insight. Underlying the text he seems
to lament the passing of the age of the craftsman.

For anyone working in a creative industry this is a fascinating read. More and
more tools are available for designers and developers. It is easier than ever to
produce creative work, quickly and easily. But as Gill suggests if you leave
creation solely to technology you lose the humanity that is so crucial to
creation.

What then would Gill think of the internet? I am sure he would be excited by the
posibilities it would offer him. At the same time I think he would be concerned
by the immediacy of creation and the lack of craftsmanship. I think he would be
heartened by the small community who relish the opportunity to to work their
craft on the web and the ability for them to share their knowledge with everyone
across the globe. He would be frustrated by the constraints that machines place
on his typographic skill. And Gill would have a blog - it would be great.
