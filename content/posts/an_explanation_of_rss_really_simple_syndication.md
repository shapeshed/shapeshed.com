Really Simple Syndication is a technology that has existed on the web for a few
years. This is a non-techincal explanation of what it is and how it works. In
short it does two things:

- It allows content from a site to be syndicated to (or displayed on) other
  sites. This might be your latest news, your price list, or anything else for
  that matter. When you publish new content it can be automatically updated and
  displayed on other sites. This can be extremely useful in publishing your
  content elsewhere at little or no cost. Of course you need to agree this with
  other sites first!
- Secondly it allows users to be automatically notified of new content without
  needing to visit your site.

## How to subscribe to a feed

![Copy link][1]

In order to subscribe to a RSS Feed you need a Newsreader. There are many
options here both free and not free. Personally I use [Thunderbird][2] on
Windows and [Vienna][3] on Macintosh. Both are free and work very well.

To subscribe you need the URL of the feed. This is much like a traditional link.
You can copy the link by right clicking and choosing copy, or copy link location
(depending on which brower you use).

Each Newsreader has a slightly different way off adding a URL but it should be
straightforward and obvious. On Vienna it is "Add a new Subcription".

Paste the link into the reader and that's it! Your Newsreader will now check at
regular intervals and if there is a new story it will be downloaded. There is no
need for you to visit a site in order to check whether there is a new story.

![New Subscription][4]

The idea is much like email. Feeds you have selected will automatically come to
you as they are published. Of course you can unsubscribe from feeds as and when
you wish.
