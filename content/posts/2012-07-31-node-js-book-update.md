A quick update on the Sam’s Teach Yourself Node.js Book that I’ve been
authoring. The book is going through final edits now. I hadn’t realised how many
different rounds of editing there would be! Our designer Mark has designed a
[brochure site](http://nodejsbook.io/) for the book and you can get a sneak peak
of what’s included by downloading the
[code examples](https://github.com/shapeshed/nodejsbook.io.examples/zipball/master)
from GitHub. The publishers Pearson Education have put a release date of 1st
September on the book and you can pre-order from
[Amazon US](http://www.amazon.com/Teach-Yourself-Node-js-Hours-Yourself/dp/0672335956)
or
[Amazon UK](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Teach-Yourself-Node-js-Hours-Yourself/dp/0672335956).

We are using Node.js at pebble {code} as part of the online gaming startup we
are working on and loving it!
