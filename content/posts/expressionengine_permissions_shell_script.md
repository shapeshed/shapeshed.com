## Download

If you are comfortable using shell scripts you can [download the file here][1].
The file sets all the necessary permissions on a default installation of
ExpressionEngine and allows you to specify a custom system folder name if you
have set one. If you are not comfortable using shell scripts I've written a [how
to article for OSX and Linux][2].

## Script usage

To use the script change directory to the root of your ExpressionEngine install
and run:

```sh
exp_permissions.sh
```

You'll be asked for the system folder name. If you have changed this for any
reason enter it here. If you have not changed it just hit return.

If all goes well you won't see anything. If for any reason the script cannot
find the folders it will tell you.

## What it does

The script sets file permssions as detailed on the [ExpressionEngine
installation page.][3]

## License
