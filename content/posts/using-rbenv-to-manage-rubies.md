## rbenv is great

If you haven't seen [rbenv][1] yet I highly recommend it. It is a small
collection of shell scripts that lets you manage rubies on UNIX type machines.
To date I've used [rvm][2] to install versions of ruby and manage gemsets. Don't
get me wrong - I'm hugely greatful to the work that has gone into the rvm
project and it is still a great tool. But I prefer the UNIX philosophy of doing
one thing well and rbenv embraces that. I also really like that with rbenv you
just need to amend your PATH and you are done. It follows UNIX conventions
making integration with other UNIX tools easier - for me at least.

## rbenv basics

We have a dev machine at work which runs a variety of Sinatra and Rails projects
(including a Rails 1 project). As such these projects need lots of different
versions of Ruby. To date I've used rvm to manage this and it has worked well
but I always came up against issues when trying to integrate tools like Monit,
puppet or init.d scripts. So I bit the bullet and switched to rbenv.

Each app has a UNIX user so rbenv is installed locally for each user when logged
in as the user account

```sh
cd
git clone git://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv.git .rbenv
```

You need to load rbenv into the shell and you are good to go

```sh
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

If you have installed [ruby-build][3] you can then install rubies with
`rbenv install`.

```sh
rbenv install 1.9.3-rc1
```

You can set a global ruby for the user account with

```sh
rbenv global 1.9.3-rc1
```

And you can also use an `.rbenv-version` file to set the version. I choose to
use this in projects and check it into git.

## Deployment with capistrano

I like that rbenv doesn't try and manage rubies for you - we have [bundler][4]
for that. I deploy as the same user as the app accounts so I just need to add
the following to my cap recipe to use rbenv since I'm already including
`require 'bundler/capistrano'`.

```sh
set :default_environment, {
  'PATH' => "/home/youruser/.rbenv/shims:/home/youruser/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"
}
```

This loads rbenv into the shell that capistrano uses. That's pretty much all you
need to use your rbenv installed ruby.

Following a [thread on github][5] you can also apply a clever technique to allow
you switch versions of ruby by pushing a new `.rbenv-version` file with
capistrano. From version 1.1rc bundler allows you to specify a shebang for
binstubs. To use this add the following to your capistrano recipe.

```ruby
set :bundle_flags, "--deployment --quiet --binstubs --shebang ruby-local-exec"
```

This generates executables in the bin folder of your Rails app which reference
`ruby-local-exec` as the shebang. This command will execute whichever ruby is
specified in the `.rbenv-version file`. In my case I have an init.d script to
manage unicorn that references bin/unicorn. If I wanted to upgrade the ruby used
by the app I would install it on the remote machine and then just update my
`.rbenv-version` file commit, cap deploy and I'm done.

## Integrating with other tools

I like to use [monit][6] to monitor processes. Monit exexutes scripts with a
very limited shell but since rbenv follows UNIX conventions we can easily create
a small bash script to load rbenv into the path and then do what we want.

Here's the script I'm using for starting a resque_worker

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
USER=youruser
APP_PATH=/srv/yourapp.com/current
PATH=/home/$USER/.rbenv/bin:/home/$USER/.rbenv/shims:$PATH
RAILS_ENV=production

cd $APP_PATH
RAILS_ENV=$RAILS_ENV bin/rake environment resque:work& > $APP_PATH/log/resque_worker.log
echo $! > $APP_PATH/tmp/pids/resque_worker.pid
```

Then my monit task looks like this

```bash
check process yourapp_resque_worker
    with pidfile /srv/yourapp.com/current/tmp/pids/resque_worker.pid
    start program = "/bin/sh -c '/home/youruser/bin/start_resque_worker.sh'" as uid youruser and gid youruser
    stop program = "/bin/sh -c 'cd /srv/yourapp.com/current && kill -s quit `cat tmp/pids/resque_worker.pid` && rm -f tmp/pids/resque_worker.pid; exit 0;'"
```

## Better separation

By using rbenv, bundler, capistrano and monit together we have great separation
between what these tools do

- rbenv manages rubies
- bundler manages gems
- capistrano manages deployments
- monit monitors processes

This feels clean and manageable to me.

By using binstubs with the `ruby-local-exec` shebang we also separate our app
from versions of rubies, init.d and monit scripts, making it super easy to
upgrade.

## Thanks rvm, onwards with rbenv

I'm really grateful to Wayne E Seguin and the work he has put into rvm and I
hope the project continues to thrive. rbenv fits the way I work though and I'm
really enjoying using it. It makes piecing tools like puppet, monit, init.d
scripts, capistrano and bundler much easier, so a big thanks to [Sam
Stephenson][7] for creating it.
