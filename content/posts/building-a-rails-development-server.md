At [pebble.code][2] where I work we have a Ubuntu 10.04 LTS server for our Rails
and Ruby projects. We use this mostly internally but sometimes expose sites
outside of our network to allow clients to quickly review work. When we started
the business we built the Rails stack using the standard tools - [Apache][3] and
[Passenger][4]. As our client list grew and we took on a couple of legacy
projects we found that this stack no longer matched the environments that we
were deploying too and didn't give us the flexibility we wanted. So here's how
we changed it.

## Promoting nginx to port 80

[Nginx][5] is quite simply an awesome web server. It is simple to configure, the
memory footprint is small and it can be used to proxy traffic through the web
server of our choice and can serve static assets like html, images and css
directly before it hits the Rails app.

From having the ability to serve Rails sites only from Apache and Passenger we
have moved to this.

![Nginx Proxy Diagram][1]

We've moved Apache to port 81 so if a site needs to be tested on that setup we
can still do it. Otherwise we can proxy from nginx directly to Apache. The real
flexibility comes from the server we use to serve the Rails app. We deploy by
choice on [Thin][6] or [Unicorn][7] so we can replicate this stack easily. We
are looking at [Goliath][8] at the moment so we could easily add this in beneath
Nginx. We are playing with some other technologies like [Node.js][9] too. With
Nginx we can support this too.

## Getting nginx

If you want to make the switch on Ubuntu there is a PPA repo you can add

```sh
sudo -s
nginx=stable # use nginx=development for latest development version
add-apt-repository ppa:nginx/$nginx
apt-get update
apt-get install nginx
```

If you are currently using Apache you'll need to decide whether or not to keep
it on port 80. We switched Apache to port 81 and promoted Nginx to port 80.

## Example configs

The Ubuntu install uses `sites-available` and `sites-enabled` folders to allow
you to create site configs. Here are some examples that you can use to get you
started.

Logs are disabled in these examples. If you want logging just add a path to the
log file.

### Default proxy settings

To keep your Nginx configs nice and DRY you can add a file to hold common proxy
settings under `/etc/nginx/conf.d` called in my case proxy.conf

```nginx
proxy_redirect     off;

proxy_set_header   Host             $host;
proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP        $remote_addr;
proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For  $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
proxy_max_temp_file_size 0;

client_max_body_size       10m;
client_body_buffer_size    128k;

proxy_connect_timeout      90;
proxy_send_timeout         90;
proxy_read_timeout         90;

proxy_buffer_size          4k;
proxy_buffers              4 32k;
proxy_busy_buffers_size    64k;
proxy_temp_file_write_size 64k;
```

### Proxy to Apache

This expects that you have setup an Apache virtual host on port 81.

```nginx
server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  site1.com;

    access_log  off;
    error_log off;

    location / {
        proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:81/;
    }
}
```

### Proxy to Thin

```nginx
upstream thin {
    server unix:/var/www/vhosts/site2.com/httpdocs/current/tmp/sockets/thin.0.sock;
}
server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  site2.com;

    access_log  off;
    error_log off;

    location / {
        proxy_pass         http://thin;
    }
}
```

### Proxy to Unicorn

```nginx
upstream unicorn {
    server unix:/var/www/vhosts/site3.com/httpdocs/current/tmp/sockets/unicorn.sock fail_timeout=0;
}
server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  site3.com;

    access_log  off;
    error_log off;

    location / {
        proxy_pass         http://unicorn;
    }
}
```

## So which one is best?

Having played a fair bit recently with servers to serve up Rails apps there
isn't a clear answer I'm afraid. I may get round to publishing my rudimentary
benchmarks but I've found that for low memory deployments Nginx and Thin is a
great choice. The response times are excellent and memory usage is much lower
than Passenger or Unicorn. Thin doesn't come with the same in-built load
balancing that you get with Unicorn so [HAProxy][10] comes in to play here.
HAProxy is another piece in the stack though which may put some off.

If memory isn't an issue then Unicorn behind Nginx is a great choice. The
rolling deployments are a great feature, but you also get free load balancing
with Unicorn thanks to the [power of UNIX][11].

If you are not interested in memory or tweaking you are probably best with
Passenger behind Nginx.

If you are not interested in doing any sys admin work use [Heroku][12],
[EngineYard][13] or [Brightbox][14].

## Conclusion

If you are rolling your own servers and using Apache switch to Nginx!
