## What is the cut command in UNIX?

The `cut` command in UNIX is a command line utility for cutting sections from
each line of files and writing the result to standard output. It can be used to
cut parts of a line by byte position, character and delimiter. It can also be
used to cut data from file formats like CSV.

## How to cut by byte position

To cut out a section of a line by specifying a byte position use the `-b`
option.

```sh
echo 'baz' | cut -b 2
a
echo 'baz' | cut -b 1-2
ba
echo 'baz' | cut -b 1,3
bz
```

## How to cut by character

To cut by character use the `-c` option. This selects the characters given to
the `-c` option. This can be a list of comma separated numbers, a range of
numbers or a single number.

Where your input stream is character based `-c` can be a better option than
selecting by bytes as often characters are more than one byte.

In the following example character ‘♣’ is three bytes. By using the `-c` option
the character can be correctly selected along with any other characters that are
of interest.

```sh
echo '♣foobar' | cut -c 1,6
♣a
echo '♣foobar' | cut -c 1-3
♣fo
```

## How to cut based on a delimiter

To cut using a delimiter use the `-d` option. This is normally used in
conjunction with the `-f` option to specify the field that should be cut.

In the following example a CSV file exists and is saved as `names.csv`.

```sh
John,Smith,34,London
Arthur,Evans,21,Newport
George,Jones,32,Truro
```

The delimiter can be set to a comma with `-d ','`. `cut` can then pull out the
fields of interest with the `-f` flag. In the following example the first field
is cut.

```sh
cut -d ',' -f 1 names.csv
John
Arthur
George
```

Multiple fields can be cut by passing a comma separated list.

```sh
cut -d ',' -f 1,4 names.csv
John,London
Arthur,Newport
George,Truro
```

## How to cut by complement pattern

To cut by complement us the `--complement` option. Note this option is not
available on the BSD version of `cut`. The `--complement` option selects the
_inverse_ of the options passed to cut.

In the following example the `-c` option is used to select the first character.
Because the `--complement` option is also passed to `cut` the second and third
characters are cut.

```sh
echo 'foo' | cut --complement -c 1
oo
```

## How to modify the output delimiter

To modify the output delimiter use the `--output-delimiter` option. Note that
this option is not available on the BSD version of `cut`. In the following
example a semi-colon is converted to a space and the first, third and fourth
fields are selected.

```sh
echo 'how;now;brown;cow' | cut -d ';' -f 1,3,4 --output-delimiter=' '
how brown cow
```
