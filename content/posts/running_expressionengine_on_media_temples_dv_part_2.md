## Working with 256k

At just 256k dedicated RAM the [Media Temple Base][1] is not exactly top of the
range. In fact it is pretty much rock bottom. But for the money it is a good
deal. If you optimise your server the (dv) Base can happily run multiple
installs of ExpressionEngine with medium levels of traffic.

This article is advice only. No responsibility will be taken for following the
instructions below.

## Moving email off (dv)

After around 6 months of using the (dv) Base I found that the server was
regularly complaining that it was running out of memory. The box was running
around 15 sites and 30 email accounts. Around that time [Google Hosted
Services][2] emerged and after a month or so of testing with my own account I
made the switch. Moving email off the (dv) to Google has improved the service
offering to clients and reduced the load on the box. None of my clients have
found any problems.

To move to Google Hosted Services you need to set up the account and then (and
only when) you are ready amend the DNS records for each domain. This can be done
through the Media Temple control panel.

## Optimise Apache and MySQL

Media Temple have posted a [series of articles][3] on optimising the (dv)
server. Following these will reduce the load on the server and free up some
precious RAM.

Dave Seah has also posted a series of articles targeted at using WordPress on
the (dv). Although these are focussed on WordPress all of them are worth reading
and following:

- [Configuring a Media Temple (dv) Base for WordPress][4]
- [Monitoring My Media Temple (dv) Base Memory Usage][5]
- [Other Optimizations for the Media Temple (dv) Base][6]

There are some useful comments in these articles here that can help you squeeze
every last ounce of RAM out of your server.

## Turn off anything you don't need

Plesk is configured to start services on boot even if you are not using them so
you can go through and disable them. To do this you remove execute permissions
from the start up scripts in the /etc/init.d/ folder. So for example I'm not
using the courier-imap service so the following command stops it from starting.

    chmod a-x /etc/init.d/courier-imap

If I want to turn it back on at a later date I can just use

     chmod a+x /etc/init.d/courier-imap

Here are the services I disabled - remember I'm not using email on the (dv).

- courier-imap
- drwebd
- mailman
- named
- postgresql
- psa-spamassassin

After doing all this and following the items above the amount of RAM in use has
more than halved and the box is now happily running using about 35% of the
allocated 256k or RAM.
