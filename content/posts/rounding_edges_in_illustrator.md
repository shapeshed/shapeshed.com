Here's the [Illustrator file][1] for these examples

## The technique

Rounding the edge of pretty much anything in Illustrator is quite straight
forward. In this example we will curve the edges of a star. This technique works
for pretty much any object through. First we draw a star using the Star Tool.
The star has a pink fill and an orange stroke of 5pt.

With the star selected go to Object > Path > Offset Path. In the dialog box turn
on the Preview option so you can see how it is going to turn out. Select an
offset of 3pt and choose Round for the Joins. This is the crucial bit - it will
round off the edges. Exactly what we want to achieve. This will produce a new
star with rounded edges.

The two stars are still on the canvas - if you move one to the left you should
see something like this:

You can delete the original star you created leaving just the star with rounded
corners.

## Reusing styles

Using the Graphic Styles panel you can reuse the style you have created with the
rounded edges. To get the Graphic Styles Panel up go to Window > Graphic Styles.
Then simply drag the rounded edge star in the the Appearance Panel. You should
see the style added to the default list.

Now you can reuse this style with other elements in your design. Create some
text and then make sure it is selected. Then click on the Graphic Style in the
panel. The rounded edges and colours are applied. Not happy with how it has come
out? You can still edit it through the Appearance Panel. In this example I
reduced the stroke a little.

With the style in your Graphic Styles box it is pretty easy to give a curved
edge to almost anything. Here's a button for example. If I want a curved edge on
it then I just click the Graphic Style.

## Another technique

If you have to modify the shape beyond the stroke, you can also use Effect >
Stylize > Round Cornersâ€¦ As this is a dynamic effect that is applied on the
appearance of you object, you can modify the value of the roundness later on.
