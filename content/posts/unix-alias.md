## What is a shell alias?

A shell alias is a shortcut to reference a command. It can be used to avoid
typing long commands or as a means to correct incorrect input. For common
patterns it can reduce keystrokes and improve efficiency. A simple example is
setting default options on commands to avoid having to type them each time a
command is run.

## Why create a shell alias?

For the following example suppose that a user prefers to confirm deleting a file
before using the `rm` command. The rm command supports this with the `-i`
option.

```sh
rm -i file.txt
remove file.txt? y
```

To avoid forgetting to use the `-i` option each time an alias can be created so
that each time `rm` is run it will use the `-i` option and prompt the user to
confirm.

## How to set an shell alias

Building on the previous example an alias can be directly set in the shell as
follows.

```sh
alias rm='rm -i'
```

Now when the `rm` command is run it will use the alias and the `-i` option.

```sh
rm file.txt
remove file.txt?
```

Note that setting an alias in this way only works for the life of a shell
session. When the shell is closed the alias will be lost. To make an alias
persist across shell sessions and reboots a configuration file for the shell
should be used. For `bash` this is the `.bashrc` file. If you are using `zsh` it
is the `.zshrc` file.

## The .bashrc file

A `.bashrc` file can be used to set configuration for a shell. In this example a
local user's `.bashrc` file will be used. If you are running the `zsh` shell use
a file called `.zshrc`.

Open the `~/.bashrc` file in your preferred text editor. If it does not exist
create it.

```sh
touch ~/.bashrc
```

## How to add a shell alias to .bashrc

Within the `.bashrc` files aliases can now be added. The format is simple. First
declare the command you wish to alias, then specify the command to run instead.

```sh
alias rm='rm -i'
```

For this example we replace `rm` with `rm -i` so that the user is prompted
before deleting the file.

Once the `.bashrc` file is saved the shell needs to be reloaded for the alias to
take effect.

```sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

The alias should now be available and typing `rm` will be interpreted as
`rm -i`.

## Some examples of aliases

The following are some practical examples of using aliases.

```sh
# ensure git commits are signed
alias git commit='git commit -S'

# shorthand for vim
alias v="vim"

# setting preferred options on ls
alias ls='ls -lhF'

# prompt user if overwriting during copy
alias cp='cp -i'

# prompt user when deleting a file
alias rm='rm -i'

# always print in human readable form
alias df="df -h"
```
