## Vista - A brave new world?

When Microsoft launched [Vista][1] on 30th November 2006 there was rejoicing
amongst the web community at the arrival of a near standards compliant browser
in Internet Explorer 7. With the browser shipping with Vista by default and IE7
being pushed to existing users as an update there was a great deal of hope that
IE7 would quickly take market share.

## Maybe not?

But the operating system has not been as popular as hoped with sites springing
up claiming it is [rubbish][2] and vendors like Dabs even offering PCs with [XP
rather than the newer Vista][3].

## IE7 Struggling

As a result of the low impact of Vista, IE7 is struggling to gain market share,
hovering around 20%, whilst Firefox is now becoming a major player in the market
with 35%.

## Vista the Apple way

I'm not a partisan Apple fan but Leopard will be an interesting release to
compare to Vista. Like Microsoft Vista, Apple have released a new version of
Safari with the new OS. Apple are claiming it to be the fastest rendering
browser in the market. That remains to be seen but what is certain is that CSS
support is way ahead of IE7. With the forthcoming release of Firefox 3, IE7 is
already looking outdated even before it has had a chance to take a foothold.

I would love to see IE7 more widely used - Microsoft is still the dominant OS
after all and IE7 offers the chance for a near standards-compliant browser to
replace IE6. It is almost a year after the release of Vista now and IE7 market
share is stagnating. Safari 3 raises the bar again and Firefox 3 is bound to eat
into Microsoft's market share more and more.

What do you think? Why has IE7 adoption been so slow?
