The mighty [Maciej Malecki][1] created a [European npm mirror][2] for all the
Node.js developers this side of the Atlantic. It is much faster to install
packages from and takes some load off the main registry.

Here are some stats&trade; on installing the yeoman-generator module.

```sh
npm install --registry http://registry.npmjs.org yeoman-generator  10.09s user 1.62s system 47% cpu 24.473 total
npm install --registry http://registry.npmjs.eu yeoman-generator  6.10s user 1.11s system 34% cpu 20.903 total
```

So 6.10 seconds in Europe, 10.09 seconds from the main registry. Four seconds
faster.

You can start using the European mirror right away by running a single command.

```sh
npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.eu
```

This will update your `.npmrc` to include the following line

```sh
registry = http://registry.npmjs.eu/
```

Now when you run `npm install` if you haven't disabled verbose logging you'll
see the http calls going out to the European mirror.

```sh
npm http GET http://registry.npmjs.eu/argparse
npm http GET http://registry.npmjs.eu/glob
..
```

## Publishing

You cannot publish to the European mirror - it is read only. This means there is
a little bit of work to do when you want to publish a module. There are a couple
of ways to achieve this. You can simply specify the registry when you publish

```sh
npm publish --registry http://registry.nodejs.org
```

Or you can set this in your `package.json` file

```json
"publishConfig": {
  "registry":"http://registry.npmjs.org/"
}
```

## nrm

If you frequently want to switch modules the [nrm][4] module may help.

```sh
$ nrm ls

* npm ---- https://registry.npmjs.org/
  cnpm --- http://r.cnpmjs.org/
  eu ----- http://registry.npmjs.eu/
  au ----- http://registry.npmjs.org.au/
  sl ----- http://npm.strongloop.com/
  nj ----- https://registry.nodejitsu.com/

$ nrm use cnpm  //switch registry to cnpm
```

Thanks to [hemanth.hm][5] for this tip.

## Conclusion

If you are in Europe enjoy a faster, sexier npm experience by switching to the
European registry! You can also bask in the warm glow of being a good npm
citizen by taking some load off the main repository.

Given [CouchDB][3]'s excellent replication capabilities it would be nice to see
more mirrors popping up. You could even write a proxy in front of the mirrors to
make sure you always have a service available.
