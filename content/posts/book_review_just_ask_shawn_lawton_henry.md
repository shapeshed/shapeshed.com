This review is based on the

### Accessibility through design

Just Ask- Integrating Accessibility Throughout Design is not a book that will
teach you how to create an Accessible site. In fact there is not one line of
code. It is more of a theoretical book and outlines frameworks to test your site
and integrate accessibility into your design process. The book advises:

> Designing for accessibility doesn't require a whole new design process; it
> generally involves only minor adjustments to your existing design process.

Just Ask shows you how to make those minor adjustments with some sound advice.

### Well referenced

The book is meticulously referenced throughout allowing the reader to look up
standards and recommended documents. As a developer at times I was looking for
more interpretation of things like WCAG. Indeed advice is given that standards
should be interpreted and tested with users rather than followed to the letter.
It would have been great to have some examples of this. The book is certainly
theoretical rather than technical.

### Users, personas, scenarios

The section on Accessibility in User Centered Design is an excellent framework.
First you profile your user groups, then create personas and finally scenarios
of tasks to be completed. For me this formalised processes that I follow, but it
is an excellent resource to refer to.

### Usability testing

Perhaps the most useful section for me was Usability Testing. It outlines in
great detail how to set up and run a usability test.

Overall Just Ask is a detailed well referenced theoretical book. For anyone
wanting to implement accessibility into a project, or conduct usability testing
it provides excellent frameworks. I suspect many projects simply don't have the
time or budget to implement many of the recommendations in the book. Steve
Krug's book
[Don't Make Me Think](/journal/book_review_dont_make_me_think_steve_krug/) for
example takes account that the average project probably does not have a big
budget. For me it I would have liked more attention being given to smaller
projects. That said I will still incorporate as much of the excellent advice I
can into my design process.
