## Slicehost was a game changer

I've been a long standing [Slicehost][1] customer, after moving from [Media
Temple][12]. Slicehost was perfect for my needs - I knew my way around Linux so
I just wanted SSH access and the ability to configure it myself. At $20 a month
Slicehost was a ground-breaking service. Coupled with a [blog][2] that spoke to
developers about how to do things developers were doing every day it provided a
range of distributions and was a massive hit with the developer community. On
October 22nd 2008 Slicehost announced that they had been acquired by
[Rackspace][3]. This was a just reward for what Slicehost had achieved but
immediately there were concerns as to the direction of the service.

From public accounts Rackspace has used Slicehost's underlying technology to
build their [Rackspace Cloud][4]. In May 2011 Rackspace contacted [Slicehost
customers][14] to say they would be migrated to the Rackspace Cloud product.

## PR Car Crash

The email to customers raised more questions that it gave answers causing many
customers to leave Slicehost there and then. There were so many questions that a
further post was [added to the forum][5] which in fairness addressed many of the
questions that customers had. At that point it became clear that the service
Rackspace were offering was very different from Slicehost:

- DNS moving to Rackspace's service. Unknown if it would be free
- Lower bandwidth allowance with pricing moving to pay what you use
- Some servers moving datacenters and changing IP addresses
- Removal of some Slice sizes
- Slicehost API likely to close
- A requirement to migrate to Rackspace by May 2012

Particularly if you use more than 60GB of bandwidth a month the service
Rackspace's Cloud Service would be more expensive.

## Free markets are good

Thankfully the hosting market is very competitive and even Slicehost has
competition in the form of [Linode][6], a service launched in 2003. Linode offer
a very similar service to Slicehost with the ability to provision servers, get
SSH access and build it yourself. In fact Linode's offering to customers is more
competitive than Slicehost with 512MB of RAM offered for the entry price of $20
a month. Linode also offer free DNS servers, a great API and has also been a
strong hit with the developer coummunity.

After looking at the direction of Rackspace Cloud and what Linode offer for the
same price the clear choice was to migrate to the better product: Linode.

## The pain of migrating

I've been with Slicehost for a while so with that comes many configurations, DNS
zones and a server setup exactly how I like it. Rebuilding servers is tedious
and sadly I built mine before [Puppet][7] was around. I use Puppet at work and
this has shown me there is huge value in automating server management,
especially in the context of Cloud providers.

After the decision to migrate I was staring at a terminal with many hours of
work ahead of me, until the power of open source came to the rescue.

## Migrating DNS

Firstly for migrating DNS records Rob Schultz created a short [Ruby script][8]
to migrate DNS records from Slicehost to Linode. Once you've installed the
script and necessary gem dependencies migrating your records is as simple at

```sh
./slicedns2linode.rb domain1.com.
```

Within a few minutes I had migrated all of my DNS records.

## Migrating the server

If you are not already using Chef or Puppet there is a project called
[Blueprint][9] that lets your reverse engineer a server configuration to a bash
script, Puppet manifests or Chef cookbook. There is a [good tutorial][10] on a
basic migration. Once you've installed blueprint and the dependencies you can
create a shell script that will build another server with

```sh
blueprint create -S tutorial
```

Once you've created your scripts, just run them on the target server and it will
build the server in the image of the old one.

## My experience of Blueprint

The migration via blueprint went very smoothly. I had installed lots of packages
adding third party repositories and compiling from source. Other than
[gitosis][11] packages were mostly copied over and iptables was successfully
configured.

## Finishing up with scp

Finally I had to copy over website, home folder files and a few config files.
The perfect tool for this was scp. First I created a tar.bz2 archive for folders
I wanted to copy.

```sh
tar -cjf vhosts.tar.bz2 /var/www/vhosts
```

Then I copied over the archive to my new Linode instance

```sh
scp vhosts.tar.bz2 george@123.456.78.90:/var/www
```

Finally I unarchived it on the Linode instance

```sh
tar -xjf vhosts.tar.bz2
```

The great thing about using this approach is that permissions are preserved.

The last part was to change the name servers for my domains over to Linode.

## Thanks Slicehost

Slicehost was a great service and the articles in particular helped me to skill
up on UNIX and respond to many different scenarios. I'm sad that Slicehost will
no longer be around and in particular that the service offering is so different
from Rackspace. Slicehost was cloud hosting before it became trendy and now
cloud hosting is something entirely different. I hope Linode can make me as
happy - so far so good.
