## The Project

[Inclusive New Media Design][1] is project that aims to examine ways that new
media can be designed and constructed to help disabled communities, particularly
intellectually disabled communities. The project will be run from the
[University of East London's][2] Rix Centre and will be lead by [Dr Helen
Kennedy][3]. You can find out more about the project on the [Inclusive New Media
Design Website][4].

## What do I know?

I'd say I have a reasonable knowledge of Accessibility in general. I follow
[WCAG 1][5] and have attempted to understand [WCAG 2][6] and take it on board
where appropriate. I believe in and use Web Standards, I read many blogs written
by the standards community and am passionate about making the web open to all.
But whilst I have worked on projects specifically aimed at users with
disabilities I must confess I have little knowledge about designing for
cognitive difficulties. If you have any experience of this and can recommend any
resources please leave a comment.

## What I'm hoping for

I'm hoping that similar to using Web Standards in general that there will be
recommendations or observations that come out of the study that will be relevant
for all users and that I can adopt these as standard. I hope that I'll see that
if a site is built the right way that it is no obstacle to users with cognitive
disabilities. I've seen this first hand for users with motor or visual
disabilities. The knowledge gained from these instances showed that ensuring
access for all benefited all users. Needless to say I'm looking forward to
participating in the project.

Thanks to sponsors the project is making the the book "Just Ask" available for
free online. Well worth [checking out][7].
