## Vim 8 brings native third-party package loading

Vim 8, released on 12th September, added a new feature of being able to load
third party packages natively.

> Plugins keep growing and more of them are available than ever before. To keep
> the collection of plugins manageable package support has been added. This is a
> convenient way to get one or more plugins, drop them in a directory and
> possibly keep them updated. Vim will load them automatically, or only when
> desired. See |packages|

The approach is very similar to the [Pathogen][1] package it adds paths to the
Vim runtime path where packages can be added. This is sensible as there are very
few changes required to switch from Pathogen to using the native functionality.

## How it works

If you store your `vim` configuration in `~/.vim` a new folder needs to be
created within this folder to hold plugins. This is somewhat confusingly
`~/.vim/pack/foo`. The folder `foo` can be anything. You can keep it at `foo`,
change it to `my-plugins` or your whatever you like. I chose to use my internet
handle.

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/shapeshed
```

Within this folder a further folder `start` is needed to hold plugins. Vim will
pick up any packages added to this folder and automatically load the plugins.

Optionally another folder `opt` may be created to hold packages that are not
loaded automatically. Packages added in the opt folder may be loaded using

```vim
:packadd packagename
```

This might be useful for debugging or an ad-hoc plugin.

## Directory layout

Directory layout for packages is given as the following.

```vim
.vim/pack/shapeshed/start/foobar/plugin/foo.vim    	  " always loaded, defines commands
.vim/pack/shapeshed/start/foobar/plugin/bar.vim    	  " always loaded, defines commands
.vim/pack/shapeshed/start/foobar/autoload/foo.vim  	  " loaded when foo command used
.vim/pack/shapeshed/start/foobar/doc/foo.txt       	  " help for foo.vim
.vim/pack/shapeshed/start/foobar/doc/tags          	  " help tags
.vim/pack/shapeshed/opt/fooextra/plugin/extra.vim  	  " optional plugin, defines commands
.vim/pack/shapeshed/opt/fooextra/autoload/extra.vim  	" loaded when extra command used
.vim/pack/shapeshed/opt/fooextra/doc/extra.txt  	    " help for extra.vim
.vim/pack/shapeshed/opt/fooextra/doc/tags  	          " help tags
```

where `foobar` and `fooextra` are names of plugins.

Other than the opt folder these are the default for existing packages so things
are compatible.

## Managing packages

The new functionality in vim does not add anything for managing plugins; it just
loads them. How you manage plugins is up to you.

Managing packages is directly equivalent to using [Pathogen][1] so moving a
plugin folder into place, cloning a git repository or using git submodules to
move packages into the `start` folder are all options. Whilst I am not a huge
fan of git submodules my `~/.vim` folder is part of my dotfiles and I find that
that git submodules work for me.

In the simplest form you can just move a plugin into the `start` folder and it
will be loaded automatically. It is up to you how you manage it.

## Adding a package

Here is an example of how to add a package using Vim's native approach to
packages and git submodules.

```sh
cd ~/dotfiles
git submodule init
git submodule add https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline.git vim/pack/shapeshed/start/vim-airline
git add .gitmodules vim/pack/shapeshed/start/vim-airline
git commit
```

## Updating packages

To update packages is also just a case of updating git submodules.

```sh
git submodule update --remote --merge
git commit
```

## Removing a package

Removing a package is just a case of removing the git submodule.

```sh
git submodule deinit vim/pack/shapeshed/start/vim-airline
git rm vim/pack/shapeshed/start/vim-airline
rm -Rf .git/modules/vim/pack/shapeshed/start/vim-airline
git commit
```

## Conclusion

Vim's native package management is very closely related to the approach taken by
[Pathogen][1] in that it adds an additional location to the runtime path that
packages can be added to. Beyond that it is up to you to manage the packages
themselves, either through zip files, git or mercurial. It adds an additional
feature of optional packages that may be loaded on demand.

In my testing I have found that packages work out of the box and I am confident
enough to remove Pathogen and use the native approach to loading packages.
Pathogen has worked really well for me but less third-party code is a good
thing.

Vim's approach to package management is not particularly user friendly mainly
because it pushes the management of packages into user land. Help tags are not
automatically generated for packages either ([Vundle][2] has this) but this
could probably be wrapped up in a script. Git submodules still feel clunky but
they have worked well with Pathogen and I am confident this will work for me.
Going native and reducing dependencies feels good!
