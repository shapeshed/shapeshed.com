The HTML5 Geolocation API is now widely supported and can be used across a range
of mobile and desktop browsers. It is even supported from IE9 up in Internet
Explorer. It allows you to request the geolocation of a user's browser including
altitude, speed and direction of travel.

## Basic usage

This allows you to get a single location. Note that the browser will ask the
user for permission to provide geolocation data.

![Brower requesting access to geolocation][5]

```javascript
var geoSuccessHandler = function (position) {
  console.log(position);
};

navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(geoSuccessHandler);
```

This returns a `Position` object with longitude, latitude and more.

```javascript
{
  timestamp:1389094994694,
  coords: {
    speed: null,
    heading: null,
    altitudeAccuracy: null,
    accuracy:122000,
    altitude:null,
    longitude:-3.60512,
    latitude:55.070859
  }
}
```

The [spec][1] outlines what these fields mean

> The latitude and longitude attributes are geographic coordinates specified in
> decimal degrees.
>
> The altitude attribute denotes the height of the position, specified in meters
> above the [WGS84] ellipsoid. If the implementation cannot provide altitude
> information, the value of this attribute must be null.
>
> The accuracy attribute denotes the accuracy level of the latitude and
> longitude coordinates. It is specified in meters and must be supported by all
> implementations. The value of the accuracy attribute must be a non-negative
> real number.
>
> The altitudeAccuracy attribute is specified in meters. If the implementation
> cannot provide altitude information, the value of this attribute must be null.
> Otherwise, the value of the altitudeAccuracy attribute must be a non-negative
> real number.
>
> The accuracy and altitudeAccuracy values returned by an implementation should
> correspond to a 95% confidence level.
>
> The heading attribute denotes the direction of travel of the hosting device
> and is specified in degrees, where 0° ≤ heading < 360°, counting clockwise
> relative to the true north. If the implementation cannot provide heading
> information, the value of this attribute must be null. If the hosting device
> is stationary (i.e. the value of the speed attribute is 0), then the value of
> the heading attribute must be NaN.
>
> The speed attribute denotes the magnitude of the horizontal component of the
> hosting device's current velocity and is specified in meters per second. If
> the implementation cannot provide speed information, the value of this
> attribute must be null. Otherwise, the value of the speed attribute must be a
> non-negative real number.

## Watching a location

You watch a location as follows. Each time the device location is updated the
success handler will be called.

```javascript
var geoSuccessHandler = function (position) {
  console.log(position);
};

var watchLocation = navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(geoSuccessHandler);
```

To stop watching a location use `clearWatch`.

```javascript
navigator.geolocation.clearWatch(watchLocation);
```

## Error handling

The geolocation methods support passing a second function to be called when
there is an error. This will pass a `PositionError` object to the function.

````javascript
var geoSuccessHandler = function (position) {
    console.log(position);
};

var geoErrorHandler = function (error) {
    console.log(error);
};

navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(geoSuccessHandler, geoErrorHandler);

If the user denies access to geolocation the `PositionError` object looks like
this.

```javascript
    {
      message: "User denied Geolocation",
      code: 1,
    }
````

The code number maps to the following scenarios:

- PERMISSION_DENIED: 1 - The user chose to deny access to geolocation.
- POSITION_UNAVAILABLE: 2 - It wasn't possible to get a location.
- TIMEOUT: 3 - It took too long to get the user's location.

## More options

You can pass a third argument to `getCurrentPosition()` and `watchPosition()`
that allows you to set some options.

- <strong>enableHighAccuracy</strong> (boolean) - this requests the most
  accurate location which may mean it takes longer or uses more battery. This
  defaults to false.
- <strong>timeout</strong> (number) - This represents the amount of time before
  the browser considers the geolocation request to have timed out. If this is
  trigger the error handler will get a code of 3. The default value for this is
  Infinity.
- <strong>maximumAge</strong> (number) - This allows the browser to return a
  cached location if the cache is not greater than the time given in
  milliseconds. So if you specify 0 you want a fresh value. If you specify
  Infinity you get a cached value. The default value is 0.

A full example with `PositionOptions` specified looks like this

```javascript
var geoSuccessHandler = function (position) {
  console.log(position);
};

var geoErrorHandler = function (error) {
  console.log(error);
};

var positionOptions = {
  enableHighAccuracy: true,
  timeout: 1000,
  maximumAge: 500,
};

navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
  geoSuccessHandler,
  geoErrorHandler,
  positionOptions
);
```
