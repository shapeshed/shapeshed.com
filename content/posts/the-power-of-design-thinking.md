+++

Many organisations are seeking to become more Innovative, Agile and Creative. A
Design Thinking workshop is a practical way to get started with understanding
how Innovation, Agility and Creativity can be fostered within even the most
traditional of organisations.

### Working together

A Design Thinking Workshop allows an organisation to confront a single problem
as a group. For the duration of the workshop traditional roles and hierarchies
are set aside. Everyone has the common goal of working collaboratively on a
single idea. At the end of the day groups present an idea back to their peers.

Creativity can come from anywhere. It could be the CEO who has a brilliant idea
but equally transformative ideas have come from PAs, Office Cleaners and
Interns. A well-facilitated Design Thinking workshop levels the playing field,
and allows ideas to be assessed on their own merit. Part of the power of a
Design Thinking Workshop is to allow an organisation to be exposed to this way
of working.

### How we run a Design Thinking workshop

We have run full day and half day design thinking workshops. Here's an example
agenda.

- _0900_ Introduction and aims
- _0915_ Warm up
- _0930_ Draw the problem
- _1015_ Empathy mapping
- _1115_ Put it to the test
- _1230_ Summation and presentation of ideas
- _1300_ Close

### Introduction and aims

![Collaboration][2]

_Collaboration is strongly encouraged throughout the day._

The facilitator will introduce the purpose of the day and outline the types of
activities that delegates will be undertaking. The goal here is to make
delegates feel relaxed, that it is not a competition and that working together
with colleagues and thinking creativity is the most important thing to consider.

### Warm up

A simple exercise to encourage ways of thinking. This may involve drawing or
working collaboratively with post-it notes or on a whiteboard.

### Draw the problem

![Draw the problem][1]

_Draw The Problem' is one of the techniques that may be used in the Workshop_

Visualising a problem is a technique that offers two \_ levers for creativity.
It helps to perform a common reference for individuals discussing the problem.
It provides a visual map of the problem allowing individuals to think about
solutions from other angles.

We encourage delegates to stand up during this process and use whiteboards or
large pieces of paper to sketch out the problem. This exercise also helps to
identify the personas that will be assessed for the Empathy Mapping.

### Empathy mapping

Empathy mapping encourages delegates to think about the individual profiles
within a domain. An example would be a milk delivery. In this domain there are
the following personas

- Farmer
- Dairy Owner
- Lorry Driver
- Milkman
- Customer

If we were seeking to be innovative in this domain we would look to understand
what each of these individuals is hearing, saying, seeing, doing, thinking and
feeling. This is an excellent exercise to encourage delegates to understand the
motivations of individuals involved in a process.

### Put it to the test

This involves taking an idea and having a series of constraints thrown at it.
Teams must respond to questions like ‘You have to release a product tomorrow.
What would you do?’ and ‘Design a billboard poster to advertise your product’.
These exercises help shape an idea by introducing constraints. Delegates will
understand what is really important to an idea by using these techniques.

### Summation and presentation of ideas

![Share the results][3]

_Teams share their work at the end of the session_

Throughout the day it is strongly encouraged that groups work towards being able
to share their idea with peers at the end of the day. It is not expected that
all ideas will be fully formed but it is expected that delegates have something
to show.

Each group will be asked to present their idea and work through how they arrived
at the idea. Groups are encouraged to share what they learned about their
assumptions and how constraints challenged their ideas. Groups are also
encouraged to talk about what they would do next with the idea. Typically the
delegates will split into tables of 6 with facilitators working practically to
encourage the techniques being suggested.

### Conclusion

We believe that Design Thinking workshops are a _ lever to making an
organisation more innovative and for approaching problems in novel ways. By
working together in a collaborative ways organisations can explore the
motivations of human actors in software and product design and learn a _
cultural level for innovation.
