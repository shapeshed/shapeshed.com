pebble {code} is a place awash with ideas. We look at traditional industries and
see a wealth of opportunities for disruption from technology. We have written a
short report on areas within Retail Banking where we see potential for
technology to offer consumers better customer experiences.

We see four major areas that will shape the direction of customer experiences in
Retail Banking:

- Mobile
- Open Data
- Data Mining
- The rise of cryptocurrencies

The report
[Innovation Opportunities in Retail Banking](https://docs.google.com/a/pebblecode.com/document/d/10ulGhZdQsxbHHnBwd-wGBYG9rt8gIIibEIrwTdXqoFw/edit)
is available for free.
