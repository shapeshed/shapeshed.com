## What is the join command in UNIX?

The `join` command in UNIX is a command line utility for joining lines of two
files on a common field. It can be used to join two files by selecting fields
within the line and joining the files on them. The result is written to standard
output.

## How to join two files

To join two files using the `join` command files must have identical join
fields. The default join field is the first field delimited by blanks. For the
following example there are two files `foodtypes.txt` and `foods.txt`.

```sh
cat foodtypes.txt
1 Protein
2 Carbohydrate
3 Fat
```

```sh
cat foods.txt
1 Cheese
2 Potato
3 Butter
```

These files share a join field as the first field and can be joined.

```sh
join foodtypes foods.txt
1 Protein Cheese
2 Carbohydrate Potato
3 Fat Butter
```

## How to join two files on different fields

To join files using different fields the `-1` and `-2` options can be passed to
`join`. In the following example there are two files `wine.txt` and
`reviews.txt`.

```sh
cat wine.txt
Red Beaunes France
White Reisling Germany
Red Riocha Spain
```

```sh
cat reviews.txt
Beaunes Great!
Reisling Terrible!
Riocha Meh
```

These files can be joined by specifying the fields that should be used to join
the files. Common to both files is the name of the wine. In `wine.txt` this is
the second field. In `reviews.txt` this is the first field. The files can be
joined using `-1` and `-2` by specifying these fields.

```sh
join -1 2 -2 1 wine.txt reviews.txt
Beaunes Red France Great!
Reisling White Germany Terrible!
Riocha Red Spain Meh
```

## How to sort before joining

Join expects that files will be sorted before joining. For this example suppose
there are two files from the previous example are not sorted.

```sh
cat wine.txt
White Reisling Germany
Red Riocha Spain
Red Beaunes France
```

```sh
cat reviews.txt
Riocha Meh
Beaunes Great!
Reisling Terrible!
```

Running `join` on these files results in an error becuase the files are not
sorted.

```sh
join -1 2 -2 1 wine.txt reviews.txt
join: wine.txt:3: is not sorted: Red Beaunes France
join: reviews.txt:2: is not sorted: Beaunes Great!
Riocha Red Spain Meh
Beaunes Red France Great!
```

The [sort][1] command can sort the files before passing to join.

```sh
join -1 2 -2 1 <(sort -k 2 wine.txt) <(sort reviews.txt)
Beaunes Red France Great!
Reisling White Germany Terrible!
Riocha Red Spain Meh
```

## How to specify a field separator for joining

To specify a field separator for joining using the `join` command use the `-t`
option. An example is a CSV file where the separator is `,`. In the following
example there are two files `names.csv` and `deposits.csv`.

```sh
cat names.csv
1,John Smith,London
2,Arthur Dent, Newcastle
3,Sophie Smith,London
```

```sh
cat transactions.csv
£1234,Deposit,John Smith
£4534,Withdrawal,Arthur Dent
£4675,Deposit,Sophie Smith
```

Using the `-t` option the comma can set as the delimiter.

```sh
join -1 2 -2 3 -t , names.csv transactions.csv
John Smith,1,London,£1234,Deposit
Arthur Dent,2, Newcastle,£4534,Withdrawal
Sophie Smith,3,London,£4675,Deposit
```

## How to specify the output format

To specify the output format of join use the `-o` option. This allows the order
of fields that will be shown in the output to be defined, or for only certain
fields to be shown.

In the previous example the output was as follows.

```sh
John Smith,1,London,£1234,Deposit
```

To specify the order the list of fields are passed to `-o`. For this example
this is `-o 1.1,1.2,1.3,2.2,2.1`. This formats the output in the order desired.

```sh
join -1 2 -2 3 -t , -o 1.1,1.2,1.3,2.2,2.1 names.csv transactions.csv
1,John Smith,London,Deposit,£1234
2,Arthur Dent, Newcastle,Withdrawal,£4534
3,Sophie Smith,London,Deposit,£4675
```
