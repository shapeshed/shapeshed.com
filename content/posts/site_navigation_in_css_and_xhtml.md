## Semantics anyone?

HTML doesn't currently have any semantic syntax for navigation. HTML 5 is
proposing "nav" to give meaning to navigation. Currently though we don't have
anything. Boo hoo. So we have to use what it out there. There are many different
takes on which is the best, but this is the one I use. I've found it is
lightweight, performs well for search engines but has some minor concerns over
accessibility.

## Using common elements

Most if not all clients have common elements to the header of websites.
Specifically the logo and navigation. It seems strange that semantics do not
exist in HTML for these elements. The logo is the title of the site so I give
this a big fat h1 tag. I also make it a link to the homepage. For the navigation
an unordered list works well. Here's the HTML I use.

```html
<div id="header">
  <h1><a href="/" title="Return to the Home Page">Your Company Name</a></h1>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="/about-us">About Us</a></li>
    <li><a href="/services">Services</a></li>
    <li><a href="/portfolio">Portfolio</a></li>
    <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

With stylesheets turned off this makes sense. Now for the CSS.

```css
#header {
  width: 760px;
  float: left;
  background-color: #000;
}
#header h1 {
  float: left;
  font-size: 1em;
  text-indent: -9999px;
}
#header h1 a {
  width: 150px;
  height: 75px;
  background: #000 url(../images/logo.png) top left no-repeat;
  float: left;
  text-decoration: none;
}
#header ul {
  float: right;
  list-style: none;
}
#header li {
  margin-right: 0.1875em;
  display: inline;
  float: left;
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 1.6em;
}
#header li a {
  display: block;
  padding: 0em 0.625em 0.3125em 0.625em;
  color: #000;
  background-color: #ccc;
  text-decoration: none;
}
#header li a:hover {
  background-color: #fff;
  color: #000;
}
```

I'm using image replacement to move the h1 text off the screen and replace it
with an image. The unordered list is switched to display:inline to make it a
vertical line.

## Concerns

This technique does pretty well. The code behind is robust and should perform
well in screen readers. The major concern is that with images turned off the
logo disappears and no alt text is shown. Having tried a few techniques this is
the lesser of many evils for me and I've used this happily for around two years.

## What do you think?

I have been rethinking this recently so I'd be very interested to hear what
others think. What is your preferred method for creating headers? Why?
