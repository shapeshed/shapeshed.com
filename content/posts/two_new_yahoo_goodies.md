## Another Sugar Daddy

It is not just Google that gives developers lots of free things like [free
hosting for open source projects][1], and [tasty APIs][2] into data. Yahoo
employs many of the best developers in the industry and contrary to popular
belief they are not sitting round sipping new media cappuccinos. This week Yahoo
has released [Fire Eagle][3], a service that allows you to share your location
with applications and [a preview release][4] of YUI 3.x, the Yahoo User
Interface Library.

## Fire Eagle

Fire Eagle is a service that allows applications that you authorise to be aware
of your location. You can either update your application with Fire Eagle
directly, or you can use an authorised third party application to update Fire
Eagle with your location.

The relatively simple idea is developer focussed and has very good documentation
on how to use the API. There are code examples for all of the major programming
languages and uses [OAuth][6] for authentication. This is a simple, secure
protocol for allowing applications access to protected data. I'm really looking
forward to getting into the API and playing with it. Fire Eagle looks like a
well executed service. The focus on developers is unusual for a web service and
is a refreshing change. Usually API documentation is tucked away in the back
somewhere.

## YUI 3.x Preview Release 1

Yahoo's decision to publish their production code under a BSD License is a
generous move and developers can really benefit from understanding the YUI
Library. Frameworks are not without their problems but the YUI Library can solve
many common problems in layouts and interaction design.

The documentation is extremely clear with links to working examples, making it
easy to understand how to deploy the YUI. Even if you don't agree with the
methodology, reading through the code used in [CSS Reset][8], [CSS Fonts][9],
[CSS Grids][10], and [CSS Base][11] will make you a better CSS coder. This is
the production code that is used on one of the highest traffic websites on the
internet so it is well worth a read.

The strength of the library is not limited to the CSS frameworks but is also
very strong on the JavaScript side. Yahoo boasts many of the best JavaScript
developers around and this comes through in an unobtrusive, cross-browser
compatible, feature rich library. Many developers, including myself, find that
for smaller projects jQuery is a better fit, but as with all frameworks it
really depends on your project. So if you haven't checked out the YUI library
yet or haven't visited for a while have a look at the [3.x preview][4].
