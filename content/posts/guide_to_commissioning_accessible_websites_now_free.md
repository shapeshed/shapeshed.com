A while ago I wrote
<a href="/journal/a_worthwhile_accessibility_guide_for_clients/">an article</a>
encouraging anyone commissioning a website to get hold of a publication by the
<a href="http://www.drc-gb.org/">Disability Rights Commission</a>. 'PAS 78: A
Guide To Good Practice In Commissioning Accessible Websites' is a comprehensive
guide for anyone commissioning a website on what to look for and how to achieve
compliance with the necessary laws.The great news is that this document is now
free. It can be downloaded from
<a href="http://www.drc-gb.org/library/website_accessibility_guide/pas_78.aspx">the
DRC website</a>. I thoroughly recommend that anyone involved in the industry
should read this whether they are commissioning or developing websites.
