## Some good news

Thankfully we are through the worst of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars">Browser Wars</a> where sites
were created specifically for one browser. Much work has been done to get the
web community in general to embrace <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/">web
standards</a> under the guise of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>. We
are in a much better position than we were 5 years ago and developers can now
create standards compliant sites safe in the knowledge that they will work on
the majority of browsers.

<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> recently celebrated
<a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/5years/en-US/">five years in existence</a>
and in that time it has done much to disrupt the marketplace.
<a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> (with its mothership
<a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>) has pushed forward new standards and
along with its Webkit sibling <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Chrome</a>
continues to offer an excellent products for consumers.

## Mostly bad news

There is still something deeply wrong with the browser market though. In any
market all you can wish for is that the best products rise to the top in terms
of value and the product. In a transparent, fair market this generally happens
by default.

Most browsers are free to consumers so the decision as to which browser an
individual uses is based solely on quality. Or it should be.

An <a href="http://www.opera.com/press/releases/2007/12/13/">Antitrust</a>
complaint was filed by Opera with the EU, with Windows reacting by
<a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/09/272">offering
alternative browsers for installation on Windows 7.</a> This is a positive step
but does not fix the main issue that in
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/Internet-explorer/default.aspx">Internet
Explorer</a> the worst product is still dominating the market.

## Internet Explorer 9

The announcement on the IE Blog that
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2009/11/18/an-early-look-at-ie9-for-developers.aspx">Internet
Explorer 9</a> is in development, demonstrably demonstrates how far behind
Internet Explorer is as a product. There are tangible, quantitative metrics like
The <a href="http://acid3.acidtests.org/">Acid3</a> test that show just how far
behind Internet Explorer is. This isn't subjective user experience. This is
fact. It performs very poorly in relation to other browsers.

I've stated before that I am
<a href="/journal/educating_clients_about_browsers/">not anti-Microsoft</a>. I
just want to see the best products rising to the top of the market. The IE
development team, who are too often lambasted on the IE Blog, have made great
progress in bringing the product up to speed with Standards, particularly with
IE8. But they are still behind.

## What's gone wrong?

Undoubtedly the tethering of Internet Explorer to the Windows Operating System
has been a major factor. There should be a choice and most users are not even
aware that there is one.

I do also feel there has been a failure in marketing alternative browsers. The
browser market is a marketeers dream. There is a slow, sluggish incumbent
product dominating the market and many better products beneath it. On almost
every level challengers outperform the incumbent, so marketeers can pick any
angle to deliver their message. But they haven't really succeeded.

Perhaps it is because competing browsers are largely open source and have no
marketing budget. Perhaps it is because as a web community we haven't organised
well enough in spreading a message.

## Why do I care?

Ultimately I care because the current state of the browser market is harming the
development of the web. Things are changing, but too slowly in my opinion.

The
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2009/11/18/an-early-look-at-ie9-for-developers.aspx">IE9
announcement</a> demonstrated just how far behind the incumbent product is in
this market. I just hope that I'm not still scratching my head like this when
IE10 is released.
