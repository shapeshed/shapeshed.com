Roger at <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/">456 Berea Street</a>
recommends that developers use the
<a href="http://www.standards-schmandards.com/index.php?2004/11/22/8-fangs-release-05">fangs</a>
plugin to assess accessibility and I fully concur with him. What the plugin does
is to give you a representation of how screen readers will see your site. I have
been using the Lynx browser to try and emulate this but this is much better.

Roger writes a [very thorough article][1] on the coding methods he recommends
and I recommend reading it.

For the record here's my basic checklist:

- Never use frames
- Give all images meaningful alt text
- Don't repeat link names in the title tag
- Validate XHTML [at the W3C XHTML Validation Service][2]
- Validate CSS [at the W3C CSS Validation Service][3]
- Avoid using tables unless strictly necessary
- Check tabbing control
- Check site on different browsers and operating systems.
- Assess site appearance without stylesheets
- Assess download speeds
- and nowâ€¦ Check the site in Fangs
