Roger at <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/">456 Berea Street</a> recommends that developers use the <a href="http://www.standards-schmandards.com/index.php?2004/11/22/8-fangs-release-05">fangs</a> plugin to assess accessibility and I fully concur with him. What the plugin does is to give you a representation of how screen readers will see your site. I have been using the Lynx browser to try and emulate this but this is much better.

Roger writes a [very thorough article][1] on the coding methods he recommends and I recommend reading it. 

For the record here's my basic checklist:

*   Never use frames 
*   Give all images meaningful alt text 
*   Don't repeat link names in the title tag 
*   Validate XHTML [at the W3C XHTML Validation Service][2] 
*   Validate CSS [at the W3C CSS Validation Service][3] 
*   Avoid using tables unless strictly necessary 
*   Check tabbing control 
*   Check site on different browsers and operating systems. 
*   Assess site appearance without stylesheets 
*   Assess download speeds 
*   and now… Check the site in Fangs
