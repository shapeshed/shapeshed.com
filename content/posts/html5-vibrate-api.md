## Make me vibrate

Mobile and tablet devices have become hugely prevalent in how users access the
web. So much so that Walmart reported that on Black Friday over 50% of traffic
was via mobile traffic. This is good news for developers as these devices come
with a range of capabilities that are largely accessible through HTML5. You can
get access to the camera and audio on these devices and you can also trigger
vibration on a device.

The HTML5 Vibration API is a W3C Candidate Recommendation and as such browser
vendors are using vendor prefixes. We can normalise this easily though.

```javascript
navigator.vibrate =
  navigator.vibrate ||
  navigator.webkitVibrate ||
  navigator.mozVibrate ||
  navigator.msVibrate;
```

You can check for browser support like this

```javascript
navigator.vibrate =
  navigator.vibrate ||
  navigator.webkitVibrate ||
  navigator.mozVibrate ||
  navigator.msVibrate;

if (navigator.vibrate) {
  console.log("we can vibrate");
} else {
  console.log("no vibration for you :-(");
}
```

## Usage

To make a device vibrate is a simple as

```javascript
navigator.vibrate(500);
```

The number value is the time in milliseconds that the device should vibrate for.

You can also trigger a number of vibrations by passing an array. Every second
value represents the delay before the next vibration in the array should be
triggered.

```javascript
navigator.vibrate([1000, 1000, 500]);
```

In the above example the device will vibrate for a second, wait for a second and
then vibrate for half a second.

To stop vibration immediately you can do this.

```javascript
navigator.vibrate(0);
```

## Browser support

I wasn't able to find any good documentation on browser support for the HTML5
Vibrate API so I knocked up a quick test and ran it against my mobile and tablet
devices.

At the time of writing the following are supported

- Google Chrome Beta for Android
- Firefox for Android

At the time of writing the following are unsupported

- Safari for iOS7
- Google Chrome for Android

Now you know how to go and create your [dildonics][4] startup.
