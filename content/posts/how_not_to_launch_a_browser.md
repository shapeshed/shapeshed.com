## Some history

I've been a Firefox user since around version 0.4 and I have used [Firefox][1]
as my main browser for development work when creating web interfaces for pretty
much all of my career. I've been very impressed with how Firefox has managed to
grow its market share pretty much on the back of word of mouth and pleased to
see it challenging Internet Explorer as the main browser in the market. I'm not
anti-Microsoft but I consider it bad for the internet that Internet Explorer is
both the worst product and the market leader. Firefox is open source and follows
web standards, both important considerations to allow free and open access to
the internet for all. In short I'm a big fan of Firefox and what it has done for
me and for the web.

## Firefox 3

I often poke around the treasure chest that is the [Mozilla FTP site][2] and
somehow I found out about the Gran Paradiso release which has grown into
Firefox 3. Product wise it is a massive improvement. John Resig (admittedly he
works for Mozilla) has performed analysis on [memory usage][3] as well as
highlighting [colour profiles][4], [Microformats][5] and the native
[getElementsByClassName][6]. It is doing pretty well on the Acid 3 test too
(71/100 on my test) which tests the standards compliance of browsers even though
both [Opera][7] and [WebKit][8] have achieved a full pass.

Firefox 3 might not be the most cutting edge browser but coupled with UI
improvements to more closely integrate with your OS and [feature
enhancements][9] it is a pretty solid and highly marketable release. A marketing
team's dream you might think?

## Fffail!

Watching Twitter yesterday there was one tweet that summed up the launch of
Firefox 3 for me. Lodewijk Schutte had enough and [said simply][10] "Fffail". I
agreed and for me the marketing campaign that Mozilla ran for this launch fell
flat on its face. The campaign let the product down with some poorly thought out
strategy and a lack of anticipation of demand. Here's where I think they got it
wrong.

## Bad timing

Mozilla marketed the launch of Firefox 3 as an attempt to break the world
download record. Not much focus on a better product there. That is fine -
marketing gimmicks often capture the imagination of course. But Mozilla chose to
launch Download Day at 10 AM PST. Have a look at this time in relation to [other
global time zones][11]. For a global launch this is a terrible choice. PST is an
extremely westerly time zone and meant that Asia, Africa and Europe had pretty
much gone home before Download Day had started.

## Demand != Planning ability

So what happened when people like me in Europe stayed late at work to get
involved in Download Day? The servers crashed and I was unable to download the
browser. WTF? You are attempting to break a World Record and you haven't
anticipated extremely high demand? Surely any marketing team worth its salt must
anticipate this? A PR stunt had quickly turned into a PR disaster.

## Why do I care?

I care because Firefox is a great product and has the ability to make the web
better for everyone by flexing its muscles as a product and becoming the market
leader. Remember that somehow we are still in a situation where Internet
Explorer is dominant in the market. The launch of Firefox 3 was a real
opportunity to push Firefox into the general consciousness of the web and to
increase market share significantly. Windows of opportunity are extremely small
in marketing and to get it so wrong at launch is depressing for all involved. It
resulted in major blogs like [ReadWriteWeb][12] posting links to downloads of
Opera 9.5 or Flock instead. This really isn't what Download Day should have
been.

## Download it!

In spite of the somewhat damp launch the development team should be
congratulated on this release which is a major step in the life of Firefox,
arguably the most used Open Source software on the web. If you didn't manage to
get a copy yesterday you can get a direct download for your OS [here][13].
