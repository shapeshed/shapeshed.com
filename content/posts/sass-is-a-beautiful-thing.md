## Managing CSS Files

Anyone who writes CSS on regular basis knows that it is difficult to keep on top
of CSS files. Some choose to split CSS files out into components whilst others
organise files by templates. Whichever way you do it there is universal
agreement that the language itself is lacking a clean way keep your stylesheets
organised.

For around 6 months now I've been using Sass, or Syntactically Awesome
Stylesheet. It is a tool written in Ruby that greatly simplifies the creation
and maintaining of CSS files, particularly on large projects.

Sass still outputs CSS files but provides a great way to manage files before
they are generated as CSS.

## Installation

If you've got Rubygems installed on your system installation is simple

```sh
sudo gem install haml
```

(You may be prompted for the password for the account you are logged in as at
this point.)

There is information on how to install RubyGems available
<a href="http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/3">here</a> or a simple Google
search for your operating system will find useful pages.

## Converting existing files to sass

If you've got existing css files that you'd like to convert to sass files there
is a handy utility available to you via the command line

```sh
css2sass style.css style.sass
```

## Syntax

Once you've converted your css file open the sass file have a look. You'll
notice that the file looks slightly different. Mainly that indentation is used
to create the rules. Indentation is important to sass and it is sensitive to it.
The Sass documentation has a
<a href="http://sass-lang.com/tutorial.html#nesting">useful comparison</a> of
classic CSS and Sass that should help you understand.

## Variables

At last! Variables in CSS. For this feature alone using Sass is worth it.

The following is an example of defining variables for colours

```sass
!warning = #cc3333
!success = #33cc33
```

These variables are then available for you to use within your css

```sass
#mydiv
  color: !warning
#anotherdiv
  color: !warning
```

This makes maintaining and re-skinning much simpler!

## Mixins

Mixins are another great feature allowing you to define reusable bits of CSS.
Take this example where we want to apply rounded corners

```sass
=rounded-corners
  -moz-border-radius: 5px
  -webkit-border-radius: 5px
  border-radius: 5px
```

We can then apply rounded corners to any div like this

```sass
#mydiv
  +rounded-corners-5px
```

## More features

Sass comes with many more features including
<a href="http://sass-lang.com/tutorial.html#nesting">property nesting</a>,
<a href="http://sass-lang.com/tutorial.html#parent_reference">parent
referencing</a>,
<a href="http://sass-lang.com/tutorial.html#operations">operations</a> and
<a href="http://sass-lang.com/tutorial.html#interpolation">interpolation</a>.
They are well documented so I won't repeat that here - visit the
<a href="http://sass-lang.com/tutorial.html">tutorial site</a> to learn more.

Sass also lets you specify the output of your css files. If you want to compress
it to the smallest possible size it can output that for you, or if you'd rather
have a pretty nested style that's included too.

## Generating CSS from Sass

If you are using Rails in development mode you don't even have to think about
it. If you place your sass files in a 'sass' folder within stylesheets, Rails
will automatically regenerate the file for you.

If you are developing in PHP or a static site you'll need to install
<a href="http://wiki.github.com/chriseppstein/compass">Compass</a>. Compass is a
CSS Framework in its own right but comes with a useful utility to re-generate
your CSS files when your Sass files change.

To install it use

```sh
gem sources --add http://gems.github.com/
sudo gem install chriseppstein-compass
```

Then you'll need to set compass up to watch your directories using the command
line tool in the root of your site.

```sh
compass --sass-dir=src/sass --css-dir=assets/stylesheets --javascript-dir=assets/javascripts --images-dir=assets/images my_project
```

This will generate a config.rb file in the root of your site, so if you ever
need to change folder locations you can do it there.

Then to set compass off run

```sh
compass --watch
```

This will then run and regenerate the css files in realtime if there are any
changes to the Sass file (as you edit).

## A great tool

I highly recommend becoming familiar with Sass if you can. It solves many of the
problems inherent in CSS.
