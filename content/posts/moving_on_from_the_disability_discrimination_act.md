In a recent article [e-Government, public services and older people][1] by David
Sinclair, Senior Policy Manager at Help the Aged writes:

"The first challenge is one of accessibility. It is an absolute scandal that
significant numbers of public websites are still not meeting basic accessibility
standards. Recent research for the Cabinet Office as part of their
e-accessibility project, has highlighted that only 3% of European public
websites meet the WC3 web content accessibility guidelines. 70% completely fail;
17% partially fail and only 10% limited pass. This is despite the fact that
inaccessible websites potentially breach the Disability Discrimination Act."

This a very good point. But this applies equally to the private sector. The UK
Government is at least attempting to follow guidelines. I would hazard a guess
that the statistics would be significantly worse in the Corporate sector.

The DDA is a wide-reaching Act and it is no surprise that there has never been a
test case in relation to websites. "Potentially breaching" is just not good
enough. The [Disability Rights Commission][2] and the [RNIB][3] have even gone
as far as issuing their [own recommendations][4].

Furthermore the forthcoming [WCAG 2.0 update][5] is so confusing that it has led
many developers [to reject it][6]. If this is to be the basis for the future of
Accessiblity then the average developer is going fall short.

Yes - it is a scandal that public sites are inaccessible but with a lightweight
legal framework and a confusing recommendation paper to base it on it is no
surprise that public sites are failing.

David Sinclair calls on the industry to respond and I accept that. To some
extent the industry already has groups that could work with the Government to
implement a workable plan. The [Web Standards Group][7]exists to (amongst other
things) promote best practices in Accessibility. [The Web Standards Project][8]
also exists to promote access to the web for all. So who phones who first?
