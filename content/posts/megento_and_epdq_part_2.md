If you are looking for a payment gateway for ePDQ I'm not releasing my module
commercially but there is now an
<a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/extension/2050/barclaycard-epdq-cpi-payment-module">offical
ePDQ module available</a>

## No ePDQ module available

After the initial excitement that an [ePDQ module][1] was available for Magento
this turned out not to be true. The module stopped development a couple of
versions ago so is no longer compatible with the latest version of Magento.

## Steep learning curve

Developing for Magento is not straightforward. I had thought that a working
knowledge of the [Zend Framework][2] would stand me in good stead but the
Magento developers have extended this framework to bring some excellent features
into play. These are not really documented anywhere however so I had to pick my
way through a fair bit of source code to understand how Namespacing and the
configuration setup worked for modules.

I used the Wiki article on creating a [Custom Module with Custom Database
Table][3] and also used the excellent Module Creator available on that page.
This set up a bare bones module and also helped me to understand how Magento
works.

## Hacking an ePDQ module

I worked through the PayPal module and within a couple of days understood how
Magento manages code and also front end templates. I have to confess that this
was a bit painful at times. There isn't a great deal of documentation available
other than the [phpDocs][4]. Coming from a product like [ExpressionEngine][5]
the forums are much less busy so I found a couple of questions I had went
unanswered.

## ePDQ support

On the ePDQ side the supporting documents are pretty good, although the support
model relies on speaking to a developer at ePDQ. I found the support excellent
once they did respond to my enquiries, but that it did take a little time. I
wonder why they don't have forums where users can help each other out? I was
incorrect in part one of this series that ePDQ doesn't have a sandbox available.
Once I requested one this was set up pretty quickly.

## A working module

So now I have a working module that I've shown to the client and that they are
happy with. With a bit of tarting up I might even package it up as a product.

## Impressed with Magento

Now that I've got my head around the architecture and namespacing (which is an
great extension to PHP's native capabilities) I'm very impressed with Magento.
For an Open Source project it is highly customisable and extendible. I'm now
moving onto working with the client to define a structure for their products.
I'll post about this process shortly.

My impressions so far are that even a relatively experienced PHP coder will need
to take a day or so to become familiar with the architecture and setup of
Magento. Once the learning curve is over it seems a very powerful piece of kit.
