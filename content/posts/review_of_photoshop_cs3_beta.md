## Something for free

Good news - if you have got a license for Adobe Photoshop CS2 you can get your
hands on a Beta version of [Adobe Photoshop CS3][1]. It is a hefty download at
over 600MB but go and grab a copy. If you have a got an Intel based Mac do it
now - you will notice the difference straight away.

## At last - Intel performance for the Mac

The immediate thing to notice is an improvement in performance. Photoshop CS3 is
now Universal Binary and there will many Mac users who will breathe a huge sigh
of relief. Early tests show excellent results from the new version. Documents
open more quickly, and the speed of the program seems zippy in comparison to
CS2.

## New interface

Photoshop CS3 has a new interface design. Adobe have concluded that design
professionals have wider and longer screens so there is no need to have two
columns in the tools menu. You can switch back to two columns but I like this
approach.

![Photoshop CS3 Menu][3]

I also like the improved dock management. This has has been greatly improved
with tabbed navigation making it much simpler to access information on your
document, as well as keeping things tidy when you want to work on your document.
This is a good improvement in UI and one which will make my working life easier.

I can only assume that the new icon for Photoshop is a beta logo - it looks like
something you could knock up in ten minutes!

## New features - a bit thin on the ground

One of the criticisms of the last upgrade was that there weren't enough new
features to justify the new release. This might well be an accusation that is
pointed at this release. For the web designer in particular there is little to
excite. A comprehensive document on the new features [has already been
written][4]. From a web perspective the Quick Selection tool will be useful
although is not a must have, the clone source palette and options are a minor
improvement and the UI will make working easier. But there is nothing that makes
me think 'This is a real improvement on CS2'.

## Worth an upgrade fee?

Is this version of Photoshop worth another upgrade fee? For Intel Mac users I
would suggest yes - you are likely to make the money back quickly in the time
you will save from the processing time. For Windows of Mac PPC users it becomes
a question of features. On the web design side there are not a great deal of new
features and I would suggest that many users will skip this version. The new UI
is an improvement but it is not a must have.

Overall this is a great version for Intel users solely for the fact it is now
Universal Binary. But to date the new features don't offer much that isn't
already available in CS2.
