## The mystery of Google

Google do not publish how they rank pages. Google do state that they look at
around 100 factors on each page but it is known that the following factors are
important:

- Clean HTML design
- Error free websites
- Page load and size
- Unique content
- Text based links
- Incoming links

In short most of these criteria smack of good content and a well built website.
If you employ a professional digital agency you may find that within a month of
launch you are achieving excellent rankings anyway.

## Optimise your content

The role of the copywriter is often underestimated on the web. Producing content
with search engine friendly words threaded throughout can have excellent
results. Think about how users will search for you and produce your content
accordingly.

## Optimise your code

If your HTML isn't valid your site is less likely to achieve good rankings. Test
your code here <http://validator.w3.org/>. If the code fails then you will need
to fix it urgently. Search engine spiders may stop crawling sites if there are
errors so this is a critical issue.

## Submit your site to search engines

Visit the major search engine and see if your site is in their index. If it is
not there is often a manual link entry form where you can submit your site.
[DMOZ][1] is a human based search engine. Getting into the catalogue can be hard
but your rankings will improve if you are accepted.

## Pay Google to rank your link highly

Google has a paid service called Adwords. In some cases this can lead to
excellent results. Consider how much budget you are willing to spend and test
your assumptions before buying particular keywords.

## How long it will take

Do not expect immediate results. It will take at least a month before you notice
any improvement to your ranking. Monitoring your search engine position will be
an ongoing process so be prepared to devote some time to it. Eventually you
should see your site climb the rankings though and all the effort will be worth
it.
