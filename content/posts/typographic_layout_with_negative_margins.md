## Trying to improve typography

I have been making efforts to improve the typographic layout of my pages. As
part of that process I have been looking at things outside the web. A popular
trick in brochures and annual reports is to position titles to the left of the
main body text. This allows the eye to clearly differentiate between titles and
body content.

## Possible using CSS

Initially I thought this would be difficult to achieve in CSS but in fact it is
quite straight forward. To achieve the effect you create a holding div and then
give it a margin-left. This moves the div away from the left of the page. Then
you give the titles (in this case they are h3s) a negative margin to move them
outside the div. By floating everything left you ensure that everything lines up
nicely.

## The XHTML

```html
<div id="my-holding-div">
  <h3>Subtitle 1</h3>
  <p>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Nulla nisl velit
    snip...
  </p>
  <h3>Subtitle 2</h3>
  <p>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Nulla nisl velit
    snip...
  </p>
  <h3>Subtitle 3</h3>
  <p>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Nulla nisl velit
    snip...
  </p>
</div>
```

## The CSS

```css
#right-box {
  float: left;
  width: 500px;
  margin: 20px 0px 0px 100px;
  padding: 5px;
}

#right-box h3 {
  margin-left: -100px;
  margin-top: 1.285em;
  clear: left;
  float: left;
  position: relative;
}

#right-box p {
  margin-top: 2em;
  float: left;
}
```

## Good semantics and good typography

Initially I thought this layout would use two divs. This would have broken up
the content and disturbed the semantics of the document. This is bad for search
engines and bad for accessibility. Thanks to CSS it is possible to have
progressive typographic layouts without sacrificing semantics.
