Society needs to debate how Intelligence Services operate and reform laws
designed for another era.

The [Snowden leaks](http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden) have been a
hot topic of conversation in the pebble office. Our office is located just a
short walk away from the
[SIS Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIS_Building) in Vauxhall that
houses MI6 and we are just around the corner from a former
[SOCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_Organised_Crime_Agency) building
too. We know of contacts who work at businesses that they could not name and as
technicians we understand the techniques that the leaks have exposed.

The majority of the debate has not been about technology though. It has been
around the level of surveillance and whether this is acceptable in a democratic
society.

### Prism

Prism was the first program to be exposed and allows the NSA to request data
from Internet businesses via agreed back doors into the data of major Internet
businesses. Any data that matches court-approved search terms must be handed
over to the agency. The
[slides](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)#The_Slides>)
detail the number of Internet businesses involved including Microsoft, Yahoo!,
Facebook, Google, Apple and Dropbox. These businesses denied a complicit
programme and many have subsequently issued transparency reports around the
issue. The idea that data held in the cloud can be requested by intelligence
agencies when they have a court order seems acceptable. The idea that
Intelligence Agencies have direct access to the data is not.

### MUSCULAR - The Smiley Face

The [MUSCULAR project](http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden) was
exposed as a way for the NSA to harvest entire data flows passing through fibre
optic cables and switches that link Google Data Centres. Effectively this
enables covert snooping of all data that passes through Google’s Cloud.
According to reports 181,280,466 records were collected from Google and also
Yahoo in a period of 30 days. The sketch that was published ont the web revealed
a smiley face celebrating the hijack. It smacked of a calling card after a
robbery.

As a direct result of this disclosure we have seen one of our major clients
decide not to deploy
[Google Apps](http://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/business/) into their
business for fears around privacy. Several staff are migrating off Google Apps.

### Lavabit

After the initial leaks were published [Lavabit](https://lavabit.com/) became a
target for Intelligence Agencies. It is thought Snowden had used the service to
email journalists about releasing the leaks. Lavabit is an encrypted email
service and was asked to hand over SSL keys by the federal government. As a
result Lavabit decided to suspend the service as its entire business model was
compromised. This particular story generated disquiet but there are some issues
with the technology here. The fact that the a site is encrypted with a single
SSL private key means that once that key is compromised everything is
compromised. The model is that intelligence agencies cannot request any
information without compromising everything. Ladar Levinson, the founder of
Lavabit continues to take a firm stand on privacy and is on a
[funding drive](https://rally.org/lavabit) to take this forward.

### Sub-standard Journalism

Technology editors at newspapers have historically been tasked with reporting on
technology innovations and product launches. The Snowden leaks are a totally
different test of these journalistic skills, and in many cases reporting from
traditional media outlets has been severely lacking. A recent
[Telegraph article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/10431337/Edward-Snowden-leaks-could-help-paedophiles-escape-police-says-government.html)
suggested that exposing the surveillance capabilities could lead to Paedophiles
escaping the police.

> Paedophiles may escape detection because highly-classified material about
> Britain’s surveillance capabilities have been published by the Guardian
> newspaper, the government has claimed.

A similar level of scaremongering was leveled around the introduction of the
[90 day detention law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/90_day_detention). What is
depressing is that there is no discussion of whether the level of surveillance
is acceptable. Words like ‘Terrorist’, 'Traitor’ and 'Paedophile’ tend to be
used whenever any questions around the intellegence agencies activities. Yes,
the intelligence agencies do need powers but it is the job of journalists to
question assumptions and to probe for the truth rather than nodding like an
obedient dog.

### Sub-standard political scrutiny

Politicians are at fault too. Yesterday a toothless
[Intelligence and Security Committee](http://isc.independent.gov.uk/) in London
asked questions of the heads of the British Intelligence Agencies. There
questioning was broadly along the lines of 'Have you done anything wrong’. The
answer was 'No, and we have been compromised’. At this point the committee
seemed to say 'Ok. Carry on then.’ To anyone watching the whole exercise must be
considered pointless.

Not long after journalists in the UK sparked ourage with
[phone hacking practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_International_phone_hacking_scandal)
it emerged intelligence agencies were tapping
[leaders of Allied states](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/23/merkel-phone-tapped_n_4150812.html).
There seems to be little understanding among politicians around what is an isn’t
acceptable for their intelligence agencies around this issue. The Agencies
operate within laws that were not designed for the Internet age and with a level
of transparency that was designed for the cold war. Put simply for everyone to
move forward this cannot continue.

### Two cultures coliding

In the context of these leaks we are seeing two worlds collide. The open, free
Internet that was originally designed for academics and researchers to exchange
information and the shadowy world of spying.

The web has disrupted business models, toppled governments, and it is
democratising power structures everywhere. In short it is eroding power
structures where a single point of authority is in effect. Ironically it also
provides the architecture for intellegence agencies to theoretically monitor all
of it. The dynamic is neatly summarised by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the
World Wide Web.

> Whistleblowers, and responsible media outlets that work with them, play an
> important role in society. We need powerful agencies to combat criminal
> activity online – but any powerful agency needs checks and balances and, based
> on recent revelations, it seems the current system of checks and balances has
> failed.

This for me is the clearest expression of how as a society we need to move
forward. Intelligence agencies can no longer operate under a legal framework
designed for another age. Citizens expect increasing levels of transparency from
the governments that serve them and the businesses they work for. Our
politicians, journalists and agencies must debate privacy thoroughly in an open
manner. An assessment must be made of what has happened and a decision made on
whether the intelligences agencies are operating within existing laws or, as
some civil liberatarians are suggesting, are
[totally out of control](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/new-laws-needed-for-out-of-control-intelligence-agencies-8669750.html).
In short it is time for citizens, politicians, journalists and agencies to talk
openly about privacy.
