## A simple start

Let's introduce the technique first. In this example we want to create a
circular pattern of circles. First draw a circle on the canvas using the Elipse
Tool (shortcut L). My circle has no fill and a stroke of 1pt. Now with the
circle selected select the Rotate Tool (shortcut R). Click where you want the
centre of the rotation to be. You should see a small turquoise target icon
appear. Now rotate the shape by clicking above the shape and dragging. If you
hold ALT the shape will duplicate.

Now we use transform again to replicate the shape over and over again to get our
circular pattern. You can Transform again by hitting Apple + D on a Mac or
CTRL + D on windows. If you struggle with the Shortcut go to Object >
Transform > Transform Again. Watch the video below to see this process in
action.

## Using the technique

You can apply this technique to any shape or object that you draw on the canvas.
Holding shift as you rotate your object will confine it to 45 so you can be sure
you get a perfect circle.

I've used this technique here to quickly create a wallpaper/textile design.
Thanks to the technique it took about five minutes.
