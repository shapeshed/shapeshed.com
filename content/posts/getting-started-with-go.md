## Installation

Go is simple to install. You can install it on a Mac with

```sh
brew install go
```

I'm on Arch Linux and go is available in the main repositories. [Packages][2]
are available for most Linux distros and you can always [compile from source][3]
if you want.

```sh
pacman -S go
```

On Windows there is an [.msi installer][1].

After you've installed go you can get some help with

```sh
go help
```

## The inevitable Hello World

As with every programming language you'll want to run a hello world. Create a
file 'hello-world.go' and add the code below.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello World")
}
```

You can run the code with

```sh
go run hello-world.go
```

You can also build your hello world program into a binary

```sh
go build hello-world
```

You can now run the compiled code with

```sh
./hello-world
```

Now time to start learning!
