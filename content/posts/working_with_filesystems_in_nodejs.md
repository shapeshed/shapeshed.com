## Different ways to read a file

Node provides three different ways to read a file through the `fs` module.

- Synchronously
- Asynchronously
- As a stream

To read a file synchronously you can do this

```javascript
var data = fs.readFileSync("/path/to/some/file.txt", "utf8");
```

To read a file asynchronously you can do this

```javascript
fs.readFile("/path/to/some/file.txt", function (err, data) {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});
```

Finally to read a file as a stream you can do this

```javascript
var readStream = fs.createReadStream("/path/to/some/file.txt");
```

The difference in these are fundamental to how node works. The synchronous read
will halt your program until the read has finished. The asynchronous read lets
your program get on with other things and makes the data available via the
callback. Reading a file as a stream makes the data available as soon as chunks
of it are ready and lets you pipe it through other streams too.

The `fs` module provides most things that you need. If you are a UNIX user the
[api][8] should be familiar to you.

## Just enough but missing some things

The `fs` module provides a good toolkit for working with the filesystem but some
operations are missing. If you do anything moderately complex with the `fs`
module you will realise that you will either have to start getting into nested
callback operations or look to third party modules to help you out. Thankfully
there are some excellent (and small) third-party modules available.

## Rimraf

[Rimraf][1] provides an `rm -rf` for node. If there are times when you want to
recursively delete files this is a tool that does one thing well.

```javascript
rimraf("/some/folder", function (err) {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }
  // done
});
```

## mkdirp

If you are a UNIX user you are probably used to doing
`mkdir -p /some/directory/path`. This will create all the directories in the
path if they don't exist. If you are just using the `fs` module this is
difficult to do but the [mkdirp][2] module comes to the rescue.

```javascript
mkdirp("/some/directory/path", function (err) {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }
  // done
});
```

## chmodr

[chomdr][3] does what you would expect `chmod -R` or recursively changing file
or folder permissions.

```javascript
chmodr("/some/folder", 0777, function (err) {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }
  // done
});
```

## chown

[chown][3] recursively changes the ownership of files and folders like
`chown -R` in UNIX.

```javascript
chownr("/some/folder", 501, 20, function (err) {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }
  // done
});
```

## ncp

Sooner or later you will want to do a recursive copy like `cp -R` in UNIX. This
is tricky with the `fs` module but a module called [ncp][5] can help you achive
that.

```javascript
ncp("/dir/to/copy/from", "/dir/to/copy/to", function (err) {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }
  // done
});
```

## Other tools

There are wealth of other tools available. Check [npm][6] for `fs` module
extensions and other goodies. Personally I favour modules that do one thing well
but there are a number of modules that extend the `fs` module with more methods
if that is your kind of thing.

## Conclusion

Node's `fs` module gives you enough to work with filesystems and provides a
single API to smooth out differences between operating systems. The third-party
module ecosystem picks things up from there and plugs a few gaps to make node a
very capable tool for working with filesystems. Personally I think it is great
that more functionality isn't shoved into core modules. Experience of standard
libraries like [Net:HTTP][7] in Ruby suggest that core is where things go to rot
and third-party libraries are often better anyway.
