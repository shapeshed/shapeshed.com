## The good part

[Plesk][1] is an amazing tool. It allows non-technical users to administer a
server without any technical knowledge and without ever opening the command
line. As a product it has allowed thousands, probably tens of thousands to
administer servers without needing to use the command line or understanding how
servers work. This is a good thing. Technology should allow people to use things
without understanding them and Plesk is a primary example of that.

## My history with Plesk

I started using Plesk two years ago and loved the ease of use it gave me. I was
able to set up sites, subdomains, email addresses without really understanding
what was going on. For a license fee I was able to cut out the requirement to
pay someone to administer my server, or for me to learn basic Linux
administration. The software worked and I was confident that I could offer
clients a high end service. Indeed I did.

## What's wrong then?

For me Plesk is a stagnant product that can afford to remain as it is because it
has no real competition. [CPanel][2] is the only other major player in the
market. Why do I use the word stagnant? I use it because on Plesk Linux there is
still no out-of-the-box for PHP5, a product that has been out for over three
years. It still offers PHP4, a product that is due to [stop being supported by
PHP][3] at the end of 2007. This is a staggering situation for a paid-for
enterprise level piece of software. There would seem to be no plans to address
this at all.

## But we want stable software!

I accept the argument that hosts want stable software. They want to offer
clients a solid piece of kit that they can rely on and that they won't have to
support as much. I often feel sorry for my hosts [Media Temple][4] that they
have no choice other than to offer an outdated solution that with each release
they have to delay installing because of bug list after bug list. It is not
their fault. This is Media Temple, a cutting edge host offering dedicated
hosting with PHP4 and MySQL4! Users are crying out for an upgrade, doing it
themselves or moaning at (mt). Do they have an alternative. No. Plesk has so
little competition it doesn't really have to try.

## Help is at hand

Thankfully for the community help is at hand in the form of Scott Shinn, a
founder of Plesk. He seems to be doing most of the work that the other Plesk
developers should be doing even though his resume says he doesn't work there any
more. At [Atomic Turtle][5] he maintains repositories for the product that users
can use to update and maintain their installation. What does this need though?
The Command Line! Why don't SWsoft offer the same dedication to their product?

## Leaving Plesk?

Over the last two years I have learnt more about Linux administration and now
feel comfortable with administering a Linux server via the command line. Using
Plesk it actually takes longer to do things than it would with the command line.
That's an aside though. For me the product is way out of date and requires the
command line to bring it up to date, negating the very thing it was meant to do.
Why should I fix a product that offers software that won't be supported by the
end of this month? There is no real alternative and cutting edge hosts like
Media Temple are offering a package that is way way out of date. At the end of
this month it will be software that is not even supported. Sorry SWsoft - it is
not good enough.
