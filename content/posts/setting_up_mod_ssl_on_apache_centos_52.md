## Getting the required software

For an SSL encrypted web server you will need a few things. Depending on your
install you may or may not have OpenSSL and mod_ssl, Apache's interface to
OpenSSL.

Use yum to get them if you need them.

yum install mod_ssl openssl

Yum will either tell you they are installed or will install them for you.

## Generate a self-signed certificate

Using OpenSSL we will generate a self-signed certificate. If you are using this
on a production server you will need a key from Trusted Certificate Authority,
but if you are just using this on a personal site or for testing purposes a
self-signed certificate is fine. To create the key you will need to be root so
you can either su to root or use sudo in front of the commands

```sh
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 1024 # Generate private key

# Generate CSR
openssl req -new -key ca.key -out ca.csr

# Generate Self Signed Key
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in ca.csr -signkey ca.key -out ca.crt

# Move the files to the correct locations
mv ca.crt /etc/pki/tls/certs
mv ca.key /etc/pki/tls/private/ca.key
mv ca.csr /etc/pki/tls/private/ca.csr
```

Then we need to update the Apache SSL configuration file

```sh
vi +/SSLCertificateFile /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf
```

Change the paths to match where the Key file is stored. If you've used the
method above it will be

```sh
SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca.crt
```

Then set the correct path for the Certificate Key File a few lines below. If
you've followed the instructions above it is:

```sh
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/ca.key
```

Quit and save the file and then restart Apache

```sh
/etc/init.d/httpd restart

All being well you should now be able to connect over https to your server and
see a default Centos page. As the certificate is self signed browsers will
generally ask you whether you want to accept the certificate. Firefox 3 won't
let you connect at all but you can override this.
```

## Setting up the virtual hosts

Just as you set virtual hosts for http on port 80 so you do for https on
port 433. A typical virtual host for a site on port 80 looks like this

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
        <Directory /var/www/vhosts/yoursite.com/httpdocs>
        AllowOverride All
        </Directory>
        DocumentRoot /var/www/vhosts/yoursite.com/httpdocs
        ServerName yoursite.com
</VirtualHost>
```

To add a sister site on port 443 you need to add the following at the top of
your file

```sh
NameVirtualHost *:443
```

and then a VirtualHost record something like this:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:443>
        SSLEngine on
        SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca.crt
        SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/ca.key
        <Directory /var/www/vhosts/yoursite.com/httpsdocs>
        AllowOverride All
        </Directory>
        DocumentRoot /var/www/vhosts/yoursite.com/httpsdocs
        ServerName yoursite.com
</VirtualHost>
```

Restart Apache again using

```sh
/etc/init.d/httpd restart
```

You should now have a site working over https. If you can't connect you probably
need to open the port on your firewall:

```sh
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT /sbin/service iptables save iptables -L -v
```
