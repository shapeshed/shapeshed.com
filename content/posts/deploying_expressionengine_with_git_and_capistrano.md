## Prerequisites

I'm going to make a few assumptions in this article. Firstly that you are
working on a POSIX compliant operating system. That might be OSX or Linux. This
article does not support Windows although you might be able to get it working
using <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">Putty.</a>
Secondly I'm assuming that you are comfortable working with the shell (in this
case bash).

## Software requirements

- Git on the local and remote machine.
  <a href="http://git-scm.com/download/">Installation instructions here.</a>
- Ruby is installed on your local machine. (It ships with OSX).
- Capistrano is installed on your local machine.
  <a href="http://www.capify.org/getting-started/basics/">Installation options
  here.</a>
- <a href="/journal/using_shared_keys_with_ssh_on_centos_5/">SSH shared keys are
  set up between local and remote keys</a> You have SSH access to your web
  server.

## Capifying ExpressionEngine

In order to prepare ExpressionEngine for use with Capistrano we need to shift
our folder structure around a tiny bit. For my development I normally have all
my ExpressionEngine files in one folder. For Capistrano to be able to do the
magic we need to move all public files to a folder called public. Then we also
need to create a folder called config.

So now my site folder structure looks like this:

```sh
- mysite.com
  - public (holds ExpressionEngine files)
  - config
```

Optionally you can add a README file for other developers to get quick
information on the project. So now it looks like this

```sh
- mysite.com
  - public
  - config
  - README
```

Then when you are in the mysite.com directory run the following command:

```sh
capify .
```

This creates two files `Capfile` and `config/deploy.rb`. The latter is the one
we are interested in - we'll come back to that when we configure deployment.

## Source control

So now we've got a folder structure and our source code in the right folders. We
are going to add the whole thing to git. In the the mysite.com directory run. (I
assuming you have a bare git repo to push your commit to somewhere). You can
find more information on setting up a bare git repo
<a href="http://toolmantim.com/articles/setting_up_a_new_remote_git_repository">here.</a>

```sh
git init
git add .
git commit -m 'initial commit'
git remote add origin git@yourserver.com:foo
git push origin master
```

Great - so now we've got a Capified folder structure and the source code in Git.

## Publishing the website

We need to edit the `/config/deploy.rb` file. Here's my Capistrano recipe.

```ruby
set :application, "mysite.com"

set :repository,  "ssh://yourserver.com:/var/git/foo.git"
set :scm, "git"
set :branch, "master"

set :deploy_to, "/var/www/vhosts/#{application}"
set :deploy_via, :remote_cache
set :copy_strategy, :checkout
set :keep_releases, 3
after "deploy:update", "deploy:cleanup"
set :use_sudo, false
set :copy_exclude, [".git/*"]
set :copy_compression, :bz2

role :app, "mysite.com"
role :web, "mysite.com"
role :db,  "mysite.com", :primary => true

desc "This is here to overide the original :restart"
deploy.task :restart, :roles => :app do
  # do nothing but overide the default
end
```

Set the relevant paths and setting, save the file and you are done.

## And deploy

Deploying an ExpressionEngine website is now just a case of

```sh
cap deploy
```

This does the following:

- Fetches the latest commit from your git repository
- Checks this against the remote cache and updates if necessary
- Copies the release to a new release in /releases
- Updates the symlink in current to the new release

That's it. The latest greatest version of your website is published.

## Advantages

Since moving to Capistrano for deployment I've saved a massive amount of time. I
no longer have to track which files have changed and manually transfer them
using FTP when a client is ready to deploy. I simply type one line on the
command line and git does the heavy lifting for me.

I can easily and quickly roll back if there are any problems.

## Shared folders

Advanced users might wish to use the Shared folder feature of Capistrano. This
is a folder that shares content across releases. One example of this would be
the FCKEditor folder that contains all the necessary code to generate a rich
text editor. I don't particularly need to version this so I've extracted this
from source control and it is in the shared folder.
