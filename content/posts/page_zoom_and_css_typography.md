## Em based typography

Em based typography is a concept I discovered through [Richard Rutter][1] and
his excellent article [How to size text using ems][2] and the [24 Ways][3]
article [Compose to a Vertical Rythmn][4]. I began to use em based typography in
my CSS work and recognised that giving the eye a vertical hierarchy is as
important as vertical grids.

I discovered that using ems to set up typography is more time consuming and more
difficult to maintain. When a client asks to increase padding, you can end up
having to revisit all of your typographic CSS rules and return to the calculator
to run through numbers running to ten decimal places. But the effort is well
worth it. I began to notice sites that used vertical rhythms and they all seemed
more usable and intuative. Typesetting on the web is an underestimated craft and
for me the results were worth the additional effort of using ems.

## Zooming in

![Zoom function in Firefox][5]

Fast forward a couple of years and browsers now use Zoom view as the default way
of enlarging a site. It was
<a href=http://mezzoblue.com/archives/2008/10/07/zoom/>Dave Shea's article</a>
that got me thinking about this. Dave notes that in all but Safari browsers now
use zoom and not the older method of resizing the text. He notes that the
responsibility for how a site appears is now in the hands of the browser and not
the designer. One of the main reasons for using em based typography is to ensure
that a vertical rhythm is not broken when the text is resized. The Zoom view
removes that requirement as the browser enlarges the entire page rather than
just the text.

## The end of ems?

So will I be returning to using pixels to set up vertical spacing and rhythm.
The answer is a resounding no!

My reasoning is that using ems for typography in my opinion helps designers to
see the vertical rhythm of a page as a coherent whole. You can smash typography
with the pickaxe of pixels but elements are then their own entities with no
relationship to others. Ultimately my decision is with the user in mind. My
opinion is that it is quicker for users to learn and consume layouts if there is
a consistent vertical rhythm. The best way to achieve that is to use ems. So
even though page zoom takes the technical aspect out of the equation I still
consider from a usability perspective that vertical rhythm is extremely
important.
