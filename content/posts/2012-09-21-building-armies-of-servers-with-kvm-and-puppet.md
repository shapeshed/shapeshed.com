Our infrastructure requirements at pebble {code} are growing. Weâ€™ve got pretty
far with an original Ubuntu 8.04 -> 10.04 Linux server. It has been a workhorse
for us but an incident with bad sectors and no RAID facility suggested it was
time for a more grown up solution.

We purchased a beefy server from Dell and have chosen to use
[kvm](http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page) to manage virtual machines on the
server. You can install kvm during the Ubuntu 12.04 Server install process and
there is also good [documentation](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM)
available on the Ubuntu site. We have configured a bridged setup to allow
virtual machines to be accessed directly on an IP address.

We use
[ubuntu-vm-builder](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man1/ubuntu-vm-builder.1.html)
to create virtual machines and found that setting defaults in /etc/vmbuild.cfg
is a good idea.

```sh
[DEFAULT]
arch   = amd64
domain = pebblecode.net
mask   = 255.255.254.0
net    = 10.128.0.0
bcast  = 10.128.1.255
gw     = 10.128.1.254
dns    = 192.168.3.6
user   = YOURUSER
name   = YOUR NAME
pass   = YOURPASSWORD
firstboot = /etc/vmbuilder/firstscripts/firstboot.sh

[kvm]
libvirt = qemu:///system
bridge = br0
virtio_net = true
mem     = 1024
cpus    = 2

[ubuntu]
suite = precise
flavour = virtual
components = main,universe
addpkg = openssh-server, git, vim, puppet
```

With the defaults set it is possible to bring up a machine ready to roll with
the following.

```sh
sudo ubuntu-vm-builder kvm --dest DESTINATION --hostname HOSTNAME --ip IP
```

- DESTINATION - the name of the folder to write to (we set this to the hostname)
- HOSTNAME - the hostname for the server
- IP - the IP address for the server

Using the firstboot option in /etc/vmbuild.cfg you can run a script on first
boot. We use this to connect the new server to our
[Puppet](http://www.puppetlabs.com/) Master.

```sh
#!/bin/sh -e
#execute firstboot.sh only once
if [ ! -e /root/firstboot_done ]; then
echo "[agent]" >> /etc/puppet/puppet.conf
echo "server = quimby.pebblecode.net" >> /etc/puppet/puppet.conf
# Start puppet on boot?
echo "START=yes" >> /etc/default/puppet

# Restart Puppet
sudo service puppet restart

# Touch firstboot_done so we don't run this anymore!
touch /root/firstboot_done
fi
exit 0
```

This script starts sets the location of the Puppet Master and then starts the
Puppet Agent. After signing the certificate on the Puppet Master the manifests
for the new server then build the server how we want it. End-to-end we can now
provision new servers within about 5 minutes. Next up support for Windows
guests..
