## Straight from the darkroom

These tools come straight from the darkroom floor where the development process
could be tweaked using techniques to change the exposure to the surface of the
photographic paper. Before we look at the tools lets examine the darkroom
techniques to get an idea.

- Dodge - This is where light is blocked out to make portions of the image
  lighter.
- Burn - This is where light is allowed through specific holes to expose the
  paper to more light making it darker.

Understanding that more light means darker and less lighter is just how the
tools work. Let's start with the dodge tool.

The shortcut for all of these tools is O

## Dodge tool - Making selected areas lighter

The Dodge tool is really a post production tool. If you aren't happy with how
the exposure turned out on your photo you can use the Dodge Tool to increase it.
Select your brush and you then have three options: shadows, midtones and
highlights. The tool will target the tone that you choose. Finally set your
exposure. This controls how intense the effect is.

Using the Dodge tool you can easily increase the exposure of photos. In the
following example the left edge of the picture has been lightened using the
Dodge tool. The range was set to midtones and the exposure at 50%. The effect is
slight but compensates for the overexposure of the left hand side.

## The Burn Tool - the same in reverse

The Burn Tool is really the inverse of the Dodge Tool. Instead of compensating
for overexposure it allows you to darken areas that have been underexposed.

## Sponge Tool - Adjusting Saturation

When you adjust saturation you adjust the strength of a colour. With the sponge
tool you paint with a brush to either increase the saturation of decrease it. In
the following example we have a beautiful photo by [Barbara Rich][2]. Using the
sponge tool we are going to bring out the colours a little more by saturating
them. Specifically the boat and the sky have been "sponged" to saturate the
colours in these areas. Conversely if you wish to tone down colours select
desaturate.
