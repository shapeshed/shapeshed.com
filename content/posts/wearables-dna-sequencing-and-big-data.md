## Standing in the future

Let us suppose that somehow a not-for-profit organisation has been established
to allow anyone that wanted to to sequence and share their DNA profile. I am not
interested at this stage in discussing all of the problems associated with
that - I would just like you to imagine it.

Let us also suppose that those who are willing to share their DNA are also
willing to continuously submit data from their bodies by way of wearable
technologies. Again there are complex issues here but please ignore them for
now. I just want you to focus on the idea.

We already have a mature market in wearables, particularly in relation to
fitness and for a relatively low-cost it is already possible to wear a device
that can gather data on

- activity
- geo-location
- sleep
- pulse rate

Furthermore there are already low-cost devices that can measure

- blood glucose level
- blood pressure
- electrocardiograph (ECG) patterns
- respiration rate
- respiration effectiveness (e.g., blood oxygen saturation)

Input devices are becoming smaller and cheaper all the time and by bridging
hardware devices to smartphones via something like [Low Energy Bluetooth][4] we
suddenly open incredible opportunities.

Already devices like [Fitbit][5] and [Apple Watch][6] gather data from the body
and push it to a cloud platform that analyses and reports back to the user. This
gives data scientists the ability to analyse the network of users as a whole and
draw meaning from it.

## Looking over the edge of the cliff

What would happen if we combined DNA sequences with rich and frequent data from
the body on a cloud platform? This is the uncomfortable bit. Let us assume that
individuals around the globe have opted to submit their data from sensors on
their bodies via a smartphone bridge. Imagine that the platform also understands
their DNA sequence. Imagine the wealth of data that a network of users with DNA
sequences and data from their bodies would present. Imagine the meaning,
learning and understanding that could be drawn from it both from research
scientists and data scientists.

## Rich information for HCPs

The platform we are imagining understands the DNA profile of an individual and
is gathering large amounts of data from users. Let us suppose that it is
possible for users to grant access to their health care professionals. During a
consultation a wealth of data and the DNA profile of the patient is available.
As medical conditions become apparent users can choose to notify the platform
that they have a condition. Perhaps in five years thousands of conditions will
be registered on the platform along with user data and DNA profiles.

The resulting platform becomes a self-learning research platform. Machine
learning and data science could extract deep meaning from user data and align it
to DNA and medical conditions. I would hazard a guess that within a few years a
major breakthrough would be uncovered or at the very least deep knowledge around
conditions and profiles would be gained.

## The problems are not technical

This is not a deep technical challenge. Wearables, smartphones and big data are
already mature technologies. What is a challenge is navigating the moral,
political and social issues with this idea. To date massive NGO's and
Governments have driven Global Health programs but we could think differently
here.

Blockchain has the potential to [protect personal data][3] and decentralise it
from any central organisation but in reality this area is nascent and
problematic.

Considering the upsides of accelerating medical knowledge and discovery and
ultimately humanity's ability to understand disease and illness my question is
this:

Are we brave enough to imagine the idea of a real time global self-learning
medical research platform?

It is technically possible.
