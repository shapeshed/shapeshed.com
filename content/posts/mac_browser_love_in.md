After reading of the adventures of the Mac browser pimp Jon Hicks I decided to experiment a bit more in my browser usage. Where did I end up? Well in a multitude of places with multiple browsers open!"

[Safari][1] is great but there are a number of things it doesn't do. Coupled
with the fact that many plugins (including Flash) are not yet formally released
for Universal Binary it isn't quite everything I want. I found [this page][2] on
browser speeds for the mac which has some interesting results. [Camino][3] is
not bad and [Opera][4] would seem to be the Daddy.

## So what am I using at the moment?

![Camino][5]

For development I'm sticking with [Firefox][6]. Apart from the dreadful moment
when you have to test in [Internet Explorer][7] (I do that on a windows machine)
it has everything I need.

For browsing I'm using [Camino][3]. I've found it to be very fast and there are
some great plugins available via [Pimpmysafari][8].

![Safari][9]

I'm also flirting with [Safari][1] which is of course an old stalwart and have
even been on a few dates with [Opera][4].

If [Firefox][6] can get the speed sorted on a Mac I'd probably marry
[Firefox][6] but until then I am happy to have mistresses all over the browser
world.
