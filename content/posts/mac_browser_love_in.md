After reading of the adventures of the Mac browser pimp Jon Hicks I decided to experiment a bit more in my browser usage. Where did I end up? Well in a multitude of places with multiple browsers open!"

[Safari][1] is great but there are a number of things it doesn't do. Coupled with the fact that many plugins (including Flash) are not yet formally released for Universal Binary it isn't quite everything I want. I found [this page][2] on browser speeds for the mac which has some interesting results. [Camino][3] is not bad and [Opera][4] would seem to be the Daddy.

## So what am I using at the moment?

![Camino][5]

For development I'm sticking with [Firefox][6]. Apart from the dreadful moment when you have to test in [Internet Explorer][7] (I do that on a windows machine) it has everything I need.

For browsing I'm using [Camino][3]. I've found it to be very fast and there are some great plugins available via [Pimpmysafari][8].

![Safari][9] 

I'm also flirting with [Safari][1] which is of course an old stalwart and have even been on a few dates with [Opera][4]. 

If [Firefox][6] can get the speed sorted on a Mac I'd probably marry [Firefox][6] but until then I am happy to have mistresses all over the browser world.
