## Overview

[Puppet][1] is the not quite so new automated server provisioning hotness. It
allows you to provision and manage servers automatically from one Puppet Master
Server. It is a great solution for quickly bringing up new VPS instances. Here
is a quick walkthrough on how to get started on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

## Assumptions

I'm setting this up on two clean installs of Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Server Edition. If
you are using other Linux flavours things should work but your experience may
vary.

## Setup

To help learn Puppet I used two [Ubuntu][2] server instances in [VirtualBox][3].
If you choose to use VirtualBox in the network settings for the virtual machine
choose Bridged Adapter to allow a network IP address to be assigned.

Next I installed the two servers from the .iso and gave the Puppet Master the
hostname of puppetmaster and the Puppet Client the name of puppetclient. The
rest of the install is standard, selecting no automatic updates, and installing
no additional software.

## Installing Puppet

Once you've installed the servers we can get going with the interesting stuff -
installing and configuring Puppet. There is a package available for Puppet in
aptitude but I found I had issues with this so instead I recommend that you
install it via [RubyGems][4] so let's get that installed

First install packages required by Puppet via aptitude

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install irb libopenssl-ruby libreadline-ruby rdoc ri ruby ruby-dev
```

Now we can install RubyGems

```sh
cd /usr/local/src
sudo wget http://production.cf.rubygems.org/rubygems/rubygems-1.5.2.tgz
sudo tar -xzf rubygems-1.5.2.tgz
cd rubygems-1.5.2
sudo ruby setup.rb
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gem gem /usr/bin/gem1.8 1
sudo gem update --system
```

And finally Puppet

```sh
sudo gem install puppet
```

All done!

## Configuring Puppet

I'm assuming you have completed the installation of Puppet on both the puppet
master and client servers. I'm working locally so I need to explicity set the ip
addresses of my Puppet Master and client in my /etc/hosts file. To find out the
internally assigned ip address run

```sh
ifconfig
```

You want the entry that say inet addr: - it should be something like
192.168.3.162

Then you need to update the /etc/hosts file on each machine with each machine's
ip address

```sh
192.168.3.162 puppetmaster.example.com puppetmaster puppet
192.168.3.165 puppetclient.example puppetclient
```

Now on the Puppet Master you need to set up the puppet configuration in /etc.
John Arundel of [Bitfield Consulting][5] has created a [handy tarball][6] that
you can use as a template. Let's get it

```sh
cd /etc
sudo wget http://bitfieldconsulting.com/files/powering-up-with-puppet.tar.gz
sudo tar -xzf powering-up-with-puppet.tar.gz
```

This provides a basic stucture for Puppet configuration. We'll come onto writing
manifests in a later post. Now we can start the Puppet daemon, making the
relevant system users in the process

```sh
puppet master --mkusers --verbose --no-daemonize
```

If you see it start then great. I encountered a [bug][7] here that meant the
Puppet Master Deamon failed to start. The issue here is that file ownership
isn't set correctly I fixed this with

```sh
chown -R puppet:puppet /var/lib/puppet
```

Once you are sure everything is ok you can daemonize Puppet with

```sh
puppet master
```

Finally we can run a local test to make sure that everything is running as
expected

```sh
puppet agent --test --server=`hostname`
```

You should see something like

```sh
info: Caching catalog for puppetmaster
info: Applying configuration version '1298651839'
notice: Finished catalog run in 0.25 seconds
```

Next we'll look at connecting the client to the Puppet Master, creating
manifests before moving on to managing users. Stay tuned!
