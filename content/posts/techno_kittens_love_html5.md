## Browser Support

The latest versions of Safari, Firefox, Opera, or Chrome all support the canvas
element. Internet Explorer doesn't. If you are reading this using Internet
Explorer you are probably in the wrong place anyway.

## Why is this good?

- There are no third-party plugins like [Flash][4] or [Silverlight needed.][5]
- It is made using [open standards][6]
- You can view the source
- Because it uses open standards machines and people will be able to easily read
  and understand it.
