## An admission

For about two years before I discovered this I used to take screen shots, paste
them into Photoshop and then used the Eyedropper tool to get the colour. I tried
Apple's [DigitalColor Meter][1], and even wrote HEX numbers down on pieces of
paper.

## No more the dunce

Then a light bulb came on when I accidentally continued to hold my click when
selecting with the Eyedropper tool. The Eyedropper tool will let you sample
colours from outside Photoshop! Woo hoo! Apparently this is a well know tip but
incase anyone else out there is unaware of this I've decided to write it up.

## How to do it

Let's say I want to sample the green used on the [Times Online website][2]. With
my photoshop document open I need to have the green visible in a web browser
outside the photoshop window. Here's how I set my screen up.

Now you can select the Eyedropper Tool (shortcut I) and click and hold within
your photoshop document. You can now drag the Eyedropper tool outside your
Photoshop document and sample any colour on your desktop. Watch the video below
to see it in action.

You'll notice the menu appearing before I move the tool to select the colour. If
you right click you can choose the sample rate. This is the area that gets
sampled. So "Point Sample" is the exact point that you click. This is great for
large blocks of colour. "3 x 3 Average" will sample an average of 3 x 3 pixels
around the point at which you click. The number gradually increase in the
options and increase the sample. If the image you are sampling contains a
variety of colours you can either zoom in or use these options to average the
colour out.
