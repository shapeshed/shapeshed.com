## Folders!

For me the folder design is a real step backward. I'm not averse to change but I
feel that the Leopard folders just don't work for what they need to do. Surely
the brief of the icon design is that common folders should be quickly
recognisable and different.

In Tiger the colours are clearly different and it is simple to differentiate
which folder is which.

In Leopard we have moved to a monochrome blue that makes it hard to
differentiate. Granted it is a new OS but I find I am taking longer to work
through my folder structure.

## Translucent menu bar

This is another item I think Apple have just got plain wrong. The menu bar is an
important focal point of user action. Making it semi opaque lowers the impact
and actually makes it harder to read. See what you think. Tiger on top Leopard
below.

## The dock

Much has been made of the reflective dock and how windows coming near the dock
reflect. I feel I should be going wow but I'm not. This is a feature I just
can't get excited about! Again Tiger on top Leopard below.

## No problems under the hood

This is more of a whinge (I'm English after all) than a serious objection. I'm
very pleased to have the latest versions of Apache and PHP pre-installed as well
as Ruby on Rails. The fact it is now formally UNIX compliant is great news too.
It supports a dazzling array of protocols for both Windows and Linux too. If
Leopard is as rock solid as Tiger has been for me then these small UI gripes
won't matter a bean.

## A blip?

Apple have been so successful as they have produced designs that are
user-focussed and simple to use. My concern is that the Leopard UI shows
problems that should easily be picked up in user testing. Which folder icons do
you find easier to use? I suspect Tiger would win every time. Which menu bar is
easier to read? Again Tiger for me is better. Do you really care about the
shiney dock? Not really no - I just want something that is easy to use.
