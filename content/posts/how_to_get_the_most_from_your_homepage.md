## Think about your Homepage last

It is a good idea to think about what you want to be on your Homepage last. Once
you have been through the process of thinking about what you want to be online
you will be in a good position to choose what is most important. Think about the
most common tasks that users are going to perform on the site and if possible
put them on the Homepage. Do not make users work to find what they are looking
for. If you do they will leave your site.

## What to include

Think about what is most important to your business. If you are a service for
example make sure that your contact details are available on the Homepage. What
use is an excellent website if no one can get in touch with you? Secondly why
are people coming to the site? A good agency will define this with you but make
sure that users can quickly and easily find what they are looking for on the
Homepage. Thirdly what is your business about? It is possible that users will
arrive at your homepage knowing nothing about you. A two to three sentence
description of who you are and what gives users a quick overview of what to
expect on the site.

## What not to include

Do not include information that is erroneous to what users are looking for.
Resist the temptation to put a photo gallery of senior executives on the
Homepage. It may be good for their egos but for someone looking for information
it is no use. Avoid long flash introductions. Amazingly these are still being
produced and cause annoyance to users who are not interested in seeing abstract
phrases flying around their screen.

## Keep it simple

Perhaps the biggest challenge is to keep things simple. Too often a Homepage
tries to do too much. Most sites have two or three areas and/or functions that
are most useful to users. Put these on your Homepage and rely on a logical and
structured information architecture to allow users to find further information.
