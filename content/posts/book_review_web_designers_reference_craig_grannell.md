There is no doubt that Craig Grannell knows his stuff and there are many useful
suggestions and pointers in the book that will help both novice and professional
designers alike.

The book's breadth is both its strength and its weakness. After reading the book
you will understand many issues and pointers relating to XTHML and CSS. Whether
or not you will be able to take it all in is another matter. For example 24
pages are given to CSS layouts covering pretty much everything you need to know.
The fact that entire books have been written on CSS layout shows that this might
have been an ambitious undertaking. It is highly likely that the novice reader
would get lost in the volume of information. For the professional CSS coder
there might be one or two things new but not much.

The word "Reference" in the title suggests that the book is not meant to be read
in a linear fashion. It is perhaps unfair to criticise the book for attempting
too much but covering so much information waters down the appeal of the book for
the novice in particular.

The book does succeed in being a ready handbook to have around the studio to
consult on an ad hoc basis. It is likely you will find the book more concise and
insightful than a Google search and the reference sections on XHTML, CSS and
Entities in particular are very useful.

To conclude this book offers a good, general overview for the novice and
intermediate web designer. It succeeds in providing a ready handbook to consult
when confronted with jargon or web development issues. It is limited by the huge
scope of the book which may intimidate beginners.

For the experienced developer the book should reinforce existing knowledge and
whilst it is worth reading there is little new in terms of techniques or
innovation.
