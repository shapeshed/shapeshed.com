From the perspective of things looking good it certainly performs very well. It
also seems to be very good at interpreting CSS. This will raise some (un)happy
dilhemas for web developers who have produced numerous workarounds for the not
so great IE 6. Once this browser is rolled out web developers will have to
account for legacy versions of Internet Explorer displaying things poorly and IE
7 doing it near perfectly. This could lead to some tricky action in stylesheets.

Granted the [Internet Explorer team][1] have taken on board many of the things
already in [Firefox][2]:

- Tabbed browsing
- RSS feeds
- Clearer display of secure sites

But they should be commended for fixing many of the things that were very wrong
with IE 6, for improving security and for the razor sharp rendering. There are
still a few bugs around but that's to be expected and I'm sure they will be
ironed out before formal release. So from my perspective it looks like a really
good browser and Microsoft should be congratulated for a change. Its fashionable
to knock Microsoft but this browser will be a giant step forward for web
developers and users alike.
