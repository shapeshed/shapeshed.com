## Configuring your environment

I'm assuming here that you are on a POSIX compliant system (namely OSX or
Linux). First let's make sure we are in our home directory. On OSX or Linux in a
terminal run:

```sh
cd
```

Standard practice is to keep user shell scripts in a bin folder in your home
directory. You may or may not have this folder depending on your operating
system. If it doesn't exist create it:

```sh
mkdir bin
```

So on OSX the folder path will be `/Users/george/bin`. On Linux it will be
`/home/george/bin`. Remember 'george' will be whatever your username is.

## Ensuring bin is in your path

To be able to use the shell scripts from our `bin` folder we need to make sure
that this folder is in the `$PATH` variable. The shell looks in this folder when
you issue a command.

If you are comfortable with vi use these commands. If you are not comfortable
with vi use your text editor of choice.

```sh
cd #change to home directory
vi .bash_profile
```

Add the following line to this file

```sh
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
```

For the changes to take effect you need to reload your profile. I'm assuming you
are still in your home directory.

```sh
source ~/.bash_profile
```

## Adding scripts

Now we can just drop shell scripts into the bin folder. To use them we must make
sure they are executable: chmod +x yourshellscript.sh

That's it. Now you can call your shell script from the command line using

```sh
yourshellscript.sh
```
