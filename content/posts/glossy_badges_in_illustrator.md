Here's what we are going to get to:

![Final Glossy Badge][1]

If you would like to work through this you can get a copy of the [illustrator
file here.][2]

## Working with light and dark

Getting a good effect in Illustrator is all about understanding light and where
the shadows and highlights fall. If we determine the light source to be to the
upper right of the badge we can keep things consistent and create a good effect.

## Create the shape

First create the shape using the Star tool. The star tool is tucked away with
the Rectangle tool option. Click and hold on the Rectangle tool to see it. Click
once on the canvas and you will be able to define what size you want to use. If
you want to follow along I have given my star a one 1pt stroke of 8E9407 and a
radial gradient.

Now lets start to build out the shape. Select the star you have just drawn and
copy a new version of it in front of your existing shape. Remove the stroke and
fill it with a solid fill of D9E021. Now bring the shape in by going to Object >
Transform > Scale. Scale it down to 80%.

Finally round the edges a little by going to Filter > Stylize > Round Corners.
I've selected 1px. You should end up with something like this. If you like you
can give this shape a gradient to help with the shading effect.

## Adding the gloss

Now we need to add the gloss so it is time for the good old Opacity Mask. First
create a highlight shape. I like to use a circle and then use the Direct
Selection Tool to achieve this. Have a look at the video below for how I create
the shape. It helps me to turn Smart Guides on so if you want that go to View >
Smart Guides. Once you have the shape label the layer. I've called mine "curve"
in the download.

<a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.

Now copy the inner star that you have drawn and paste it in front of the
original (Edit > Paste in Front). Call this layer "highlight". Now make sure you
have the correct layer selected and give your copy have a white fill. No call up
the transparency menu and in the fly-out menu in the top right click Make
Opacity Mask. Now go back to your layer "curve" and copy this. Return to the
opacity mask and paste it in to show the highlight. Add a gradient to complete
the effect. This is a little complex so watch the video below if you are
struggling. Sorry for the poor video - it is the best I can do at the moment!

Then just add the text. I've used [Folks][6] which is a great free font.
