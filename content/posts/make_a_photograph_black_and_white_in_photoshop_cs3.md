## New for CS3

This method will only work on Photoshop CS3. In this example we are going to use
[an image][1] taken by [Steffe][2].

![That Old Tree (Thunder Road)][3]

## The Technique

Open the image that you would like to convert to black and white and open the
layers palette by going to Window > Layers or just hitting F7. In the layers
palette click the Create new fill or adjustment layer at the bottom of the
layers palette.

![Create New Fill or Adjustment Layer][4]

Select Black and White. Hey presto! Not only is it a non-destructive layer
(meaning your original photograph is safe) but you can also adjust the result
based on the original colours.

You can use the sliders to get the photo to where you would like or apply a
number of custom presets. As if that isn't enough you can also click and hold on
any part of the photo and then drag the mouse to the left or right to change
that colour. Pretty slick.

![Black and White options][5]

If you want to change the Hue or Saturation you can also do it at the bottom of
the options.

![Black and White version][6]

## Desaturation no more

Until I discovered this technique I was using desaturate to move colour images
to black and white. No more!
