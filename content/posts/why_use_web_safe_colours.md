## Background

Web Safe, or Browser Safe colours consist of 216 colors that display
non-dithered, consistent colour on any computer or device capable of displaying
8-bit color. Although 8-bit color can display 256 colors only 216 are displayed
consistently. Web / Browser safe colours were defined in 1996 when the majority
of computers had 8-bit cards. Today that figure is around [3% and falling][1].
Indeed [Lynda Weinman][2], credited with inventing the Web Safe Colour Pallette
now [thinks it is obsolete.][3]

## The experiment

Using my Macbook Pro I wanted to test out how colours displayed under different
settings. So I picked a row of web safe colours, a row of [web smart colours][4]
and a row of colors that were not in either palette. The results were not
entirely as expected.

### Millions

All of the colors displayed without dither.

### Thousands

All of the colors displayed without dither.

### 256

Unsurprisingly this looked generally awful. If I had a 256 screen I would
probably smash it to pieces with a baseball bat. What was interesting though was
that the green in the web safe colours were dithered. So what is the point of
web safe colours? Is it just my monitor?

![Experiment at 256 Resolution][5]

## So I can forget about web safe colours?

Yes I would say you can. Unless you want to design for the 3% of 8-bit users you
can ditch the web safe palette. But most mobile phone browsers can only display
256 colors. Although they will catch up, for the time being Web Safe is not
dead. If you want your site to be viewable on all mobile devices you shouldn't
ditch the palette just yet.

## Try it yourself

I'm interested to know what other users / monitors experience. So why not
download the [Photoshop File][6] or view the [JPEG file][7] and let me know how
it looks to you?
