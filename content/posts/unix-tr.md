## What is the tr command in UNIX?

The `tr` command in UNIX is a command line utility for translating or deleting
characters. It supports a range of transformations including uppercase to
lowercase, squeezing repeating characters, deleting specific characters and
basic find and replace. It can be used with UNIX pipes to support more complex
translation.

## How to convert lower case to upper case

To convert from lower case to upper case the predefined sets in `tr` can be
used. The `[:lower:]` set will match any lower case character. The `[:upper:]`
set matches any uppercase character. To convert from lower to upper these can be
used to translate a string.

```sh
echo uppercaseme | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'
UPPERCASEME
```

## How to search for a complement of a pattern

To search for a complement of a pattern use the `-c` option. Searching for a
complement means searching for the _inverse_ of the set specified. In the
following example any character that is not ‘a’ is matched and translated to
‘z’.

```sh
echo abcdefghijklmnop | tr -c 'a' 'z'
azzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
```

Searching for a complement pattern can effectively be used to pull out patterns
from text. In the following example the `-c` option is combined with the `-d`
delete option to extract a phone number.

```sh
echo 'Phone: 01234 567890' | tr -cd '[:digit:]'
01234567890
```

## How to delete specific characters

To delete specific characters use the `-d` option. This option deletes
characters in the first set specified. The following example removes any
occurrence of ‘up’.

```sh
echo 'clean this up' | tr -d 'up'
clean this
```

Note that the `tr` is relatively crude. For more complex patterns `sed` is a
better option.

## How to squeeze repeating characters

To squeeze repeat occurrences of characters specified in a set use the `-s`
option. This removes repeated instances of a character. In the following example
a string with too many spaces is squeezed to remove them.

```sh
echo 'too    many    spaces  here' | tr -s '[:space:]'
too many spaces here
```

## How to truncate a search pattern

To truncate the first set to the second set use the `-t` option. By default `tr`
will repeat the last character of the second set if the first and second sets
are different lengths. Consider the following example.

```sh
echo 'the cat in the hat' | tr 'abcdefgh' '123'
t33 31t in t33 31t
```

The last character of the second set is repeated to match any letter from c-h.
Using the truncate option limits the matching to the length of the second set.

```sh
echo 'the cat in the hat' | tr -t 'abcdefgh' '123'
the 31t in the h1t
```

Note that this option is not available in the BSD version of `tr`.

## How to find and replace

The `tr` tool works well for simple find and replace operations where one
character should be replaced with another. The following example replaces
underscores with spaces.

```sh
echo "some_url_that_I_have" | tr "_" "-"
some-url-that-I-have
```

For more complex find and replace operations a tool like `sed` is recommended.

## How to build translate pipelines

The `tr` can be combined with pipes to build a translation pipeline. In the
following example `tr` is used to clean a file named ‘Bad File nAme.txt’. This
removes backslashes, converts spaces to underscores and converts uppercase to
lowercase.

```sh
echo Bad\ File\ nAme.txt | tr -d '\' | tr ' ' '_' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'
```
