![pebble code logo][9]

After six years [pebble {code}][8], the consultancy I founded with [Toby
Hunt][1], [Alex Butcher][2] and [Sebastian Nash][3] is closing. Along the way I
learned many new skills, launched startups, made mistakes, went mad and worked
with some unbelievably talented people.

## Starting up

Starting up with no cash or clients seems a ludicrous idea now. Perhaps we were
just young and confident but it was not hard to find work. We started to create
the type of company we wanted to work at by embedding quarterly hack days, 10%
time, flat management and personal autonomy. Without really realising it this
would attract extremely creative and open-minded technologists and begin to
carve our niche in innovation.

What followed was a hive of hard work, lines of code, startups, FTSE 100s and
awards. We helped launch [Bede Gaming][5] a business that is now over 150
people, won accounts with Pearson, AstraZeneca and Cancer Research UK. Through
the innovative culture we had created we went on to win an InnovateUK award for
a high frequency audio product.

## Going mad

For the last two years I took on the role of Managing Director. This role
covered pretty much everything in the business aside from Sales which was headed
by my business partner. I was defacto CTO & COO, overseeing a lot of the growing
delivery projects we had, responsible for finance, cashflow, recruitment and
general culture in a business that had grown to thirty staff.

Throughout years three to five the business had one major tier one client and a
number of strategic partnerships with startups. In early 2016 we saw a corporate
policy change at the tier one client and this started to slow the purchase
orders coming our way. With this client making up nearly 70% of our order book
this was a major issue. Coincidentally the business had started to add some new
hires to delegate some of the roles I had been covering in delivery. It was
terrible timing.

By the time we had missed the sales target by a long way the next quarter I
could see that things were going to be very difficult. I tried everything I
could to think of ways to avoid having to downsize the company but with the
sales outlook continuing to be poor we had no option.

In the months running up to lay-offs I suffered from [General Anxiety
Disorder][4] and severe insomnia. At my lowest I genuinely imagined my house had
fallen down and I was living on the streets with my wife and family having left
me. It was one of the lowest points of my life.

It took me weeks to recover and I learned techniques like [mindfulness][6] and
[cognitive behavioural therapy][7], albeit that stupidly I did not seek
professional help. I perceived it more important to focus on the business.

## Closing down

What followed was a major effort to fill the order book. We hired in an Interim
Sales Director and an Interim Head of Marketing. Whilst we made some progress
and won some orders we could not land deals quickly enough. With the order
pipeline continuing to look weak and cash falling off a cliff within ten weeks
we had two options. We could hope for the best and risk running the business
into the wall or call time on the business whilst we still had cash.

The business had drifted a long way from the original vision too with a lack of
client work and a culture severely damaged by a round of lay-offs. For me as a
founder it was not what I wanted the business to be at all. Given historical
sales data for the year and the trend being obvious the decision for the board
was an easy one. By ending early we were able to pay off staff and close out the
contracts we had responsibly.

## Business: The Good Parts

With some distance from the heat of the battle now I can reflect on what we
achieved. With no finance and no clients we built a profitable business that
turned over Â£2 million, launched successful startups and served some of the
biggest businesses in the UK.

I am far more proud though, of the culture that we created at pebble {code}.
Through the simple premise of giving staff autonomy I witnessed the talented
people that we hired become exceptional people. In exit interviews most told me
it was the best place they had ever worked and I consider this my biggest
achievement as part of pebble {code}.

At pebble {code}'s peak the energy of designers and developers simultaneously
learning, innovating and delivering exceptional client work in the environment
we had created was organic, infectious and wonderful.

Along the way pebble {code} launched new products, took several successful
startups to market, won awards and frankly had a lot of fun! I'm immensely proud
to have been associated with it.
