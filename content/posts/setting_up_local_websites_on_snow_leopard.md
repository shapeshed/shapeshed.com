Not keen on the command line? Using something like [MAMP][1] may be a better
option for you. I'm using vi to edit the files but feel free to use your text
editor of choice (TextMate, emacs etc).

## Step 1 - Creating your site

On OSX websites are stored in /Users/yourname/Sites so it is a good idea to
store your site in there. Let's create a site in there. Note you'll need to
change yourname in the example to whatever your name is.

```sh
cd /Users/yourname/Sites
mkdir mysite.com
cd mysite.com
printf "My awesome site" > index.html
```

Great - we've created our site. Now let's set up Apache.

## Step 2 - Setting up Apache

First we need to allow virtual hosts by uncommenting a line in the Apache config
file

```sh
sudo vi +/'# Virtual hosts' /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
```

Change

```apache
#Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
```

to

```apache
Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
```

Save the file and exit

## Step 3 - Adding the virtual host

Now we can add the virtual host

```sh
sudo vi /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
```

Add the following to the end of the file. Remember to change 'yourname' to
whatever your name is and also 'mysite.com' to whatever your site folder name
is. ServerName is the name you will use to access the site from a browser so if
you want something specific change it.

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
  <Directory /Users/yourname/Sites/mysite.com>
    Options +FollowSymlinks +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
    AllowOverride All
  </Directory>
  DocumentRoot /Users/yourname/Sites/mysite.com
  ServerName mysite.local
</VirtualHost>
```

## Step 4 - Setting your hosts file

As there is no DNS associated with your site we need to set this.

```sh
sudo vi /etc/hosts
```

Add the following. This relates to the ServerName you set in the Step 2

```sh
127.0.0.1 mysite.local
```

## Step 4 - Start Apache

Now we just need to start apache

```sh
sudo apachectl start
```

If you see

```sh
org.apache.httpd: Already loaded
```

Then it is already running so restart it using

```sh
sudo apachectl restart
```

Now open a browser and visit <http://mysite.local/> (or whatever ServerName you
set). All being well you should see a page displaying "My awesome site"

## Step 5 - Enable PHP

If you need PHP then this needs to be enabled. You can do this using

```sh
sudo vi +/php5_module /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
```

Change

```apache
#LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so
```

to

```apache
LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so
```

Then save and exit. Finally we need to restart apache:

```sh
sudo apachectl restart
```

Now lets see if PHP is running ok:

```sh
cd /Users/yourname/Sites
cd mysite.com
printf "<?php phpinfo() ?>" > index.php
```

Now if you open a browser and visit http://mysite.local/index.php you should see
the phpinfo() page. Apache is set to serve index.html before index.php so if you
delete the index.html you will also be able to access the phpinfo() page at
http://mysite.local.

All done! To add further sites just repeat steps 3, 4 and 5.
