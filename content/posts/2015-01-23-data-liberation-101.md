As part of pebble {code}’s upcoming Visualisation Hack Day we look at the life
blood of Visualisations and how organisations can position themselves to take
advantage of unlocking value and meaning through open data.

## The end of the excel era

Historically data analysis has been conducted in Excel where an analyst will
work in isolation and then present whatever meaning has been abstracted from the
data in powerpoint. Increasingly this approach is looking long in the tooth.
Users expect to be able to interact with data and to drill down into sections
that interest us and potentially even build their own analysis.

The web browser is now a very capable means of delivering a rich and interactive
data experience and opens up new possibilities for collaboration and
interaction. Libraries like [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) enable data to be
delivered in a visual and interative manner and crucially for the user to
explore data themselves.

Data analysis can now be collaborative too. Crowd science for example is just
one way that innovative organisations like
[CRUK](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/) are using the wisdom of the crowd to
propel their research.

## All roads lead to data

For all of the new posibilities that browsers and JavaScript libraries like
d3.js present the capabilities of a data visualisations are still bound by the
ability to access and use data and the APIs that serve the data.

APIs are an increasingly competitive domain where attracting great developers
and analysts can lead to significant value for the data owner.

## How to prepare

When making your data available via an API you should focus on how easy the
experience of using it will be. Is it easy to discover how to use the data? Is
the data format the expected one? How is the data secured? Is the service fast
enough for a web experience?

If you do not already have a web service this can be a significant undertaking.
If you already have an API it is worth re-assessing these criteria. Often APIs
were created before the browser became a viable means of visualising data and
are woefully lacking.

## Be developer friendly

Organisations that understand that open data can unlock business value and
insight into data sets also need to realise that competition for talent is a key
factor. How an API is documented is often the first interaction a developer has
with a data set. If the API is poorly documented or not documented at all a
developer may ignore it entirely. If that developer chooses to use their talents
elsewhere this potentially a costly failing.

Some API providers go as far as providing API clients in the most popular
programming languages to support the usage of the API.

Great documentation and potentially providing API clients in major languages
means developers can get on with what they are interested in - interacting with
the data and building on top of it.

## Build a community

As well as investing in the presentation of the data tech savvy organisations
are helping to support and build communities around data sets. Some hold meetups
where developers and entrepreneurs can share ideas whilst others run hack events
where real products can be created.

Particularly where the data is the product this can allow the data provider to
respond to how third-parties want to use the data, developing the product and
interacting with customers at the same time.

## Unlock meaning and innovation

Visalisations can deliver meaning that would never be uncovered if data is left
on a C drive or hidden in a database somewhere. A
[recent McKinsey report](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/open_data_unlocking_innovation_and_performance_with_liquid_information)
suggested that Open Data can help unlock $3-$5 trillion dollars in economic
value. Open data and visualisations are entirely symbiotic here. Without open
data it is impossible to create visualisations and without visualisations it is
difficult to extract meaning from data sets.

pebble {code}’s Visualisation Hack Day is just a small example of how
organisations can take advantage of highly skilled technologists around the
world simply by publishing their data. For a relatively small investment
organisations can open their data to a wealth of innovation outside of their
organisation and give a serious boost to R&D efforts.
