Back in October Microsoft issued a [call to action][2] to developers to stop
using IE specific hacks. This might seem a little galling especially when every
developer spends more time trying to get IE to display things correctly. But
they have a very good point. With the release of IE7 the following hacks won't
work:

- html > body
- - html
- head:first-child + body
- head + body
- body > element

With IE7 Microsoft are trying to clean up their act so I think it is fair that
developers should clean up their acts too. I code for IE5 up and managed to
complete the templates to XHTML and CSS compliance with one stylesheet and no
hacks. OK it took me a bit longer but the code is future proofed. Another bonus
is that it makes maintaining the site so much easier as you don't have to go
through 5 or 6 stylesheets. This is all well and good until the next tear your
hair out moment in IE but my intention from now on is to say goodbye to IE
hacks! Famous last words....
