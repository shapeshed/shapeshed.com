## Creating colour schemes

Illustrator CS3 can do a lot of colour theory and matching for you. You still
have the option of doing everything by hand but you can also explore options
that Illustrator can present to you.

Let's start by drawing a simple rectangle on the canvas. I've chosen an orange.
If you want to follow the colour is #FF9933. Now using new tools in CS3 you can
start to build up a colour scheme. Bring up the Colour Guide Panel (Window >
Color Guide or Shift + F3). You will see that Illustrator has matched the colour
you have chosen to a range of others. Click on the dropdown menu and you will
see a number of colour schemes to explore.

I'm pretty happy with the colours that have come up in Analagous 2. If I'm not
happy though I can edit what I've chosen. In the bottom right hand corner of the
Color Guide Panel click the icon next to the folder which will allow you to edit
colours. You should see the following:

![Live Color Panel][2]

This is the Live Color Panel and allows you to experiment and edit the color
scheme before you use it. This is a really amazing tool distilling colour theory
into a simple and easy tool.

Once you are happy with your amends click ok.

## Using colour schemes

The Color Guide Panel integrates with the Swatches Panel. The Swatches Panel
allows you to have quick and easy access to your Color Schemes and it is well
worth using. To add the Color Scheme to the Swatches Panel just click the Save
Color to Swatches Panel in the bottom right hand corner of the the Color Guide.
You will now see it available in the Swatches Panel. Once in the Swatches Panel
you can still edit your Color Group using the Edit Color Group icon at the
bottom.

## An Easter Egg

Adobe have created [Kuler][4] an online application that seems to replicate most
if not all of the features of Live Color and Color Guides. The advantage of
being online is that you can share you Swatches and seek inspiration from
others. Kuler also integrates directly into Illustrator. Go to Window > Adobe
Labs > Kuler. You can browse Swatches from inside Illustrator.

The colour creation and management tools are a powerful addition to Illustrator
CS3 and are certainly worth learning about and using.
