The quick select tool allows you to select areas of photographs more quickly
than standard tools. Although it is not perfect it can give amazing results and
save you time.

## The task

In this example we have a [photograph from Flickr][1] by [steve.wild][2]. We are
going to assume that we want to change the colours of the doors. With the Quick
Selection Tool it is simple.

## The technique

Select the Quick Selection Tool from the menu (shortcut W). In the top menu bar
you will see that you can select your brush size. Depending on what you want to
select choose an appropriate brush size. To make your selection just click and
drag on the area you want. Generally the tool does a great job but you can
refine the selection by adding (SHIFT) or subtracting (CTRL).

After using the Quick Selection Tool I've selected both doors in a matter of
seconds.

So I keep the original image I'm going to create a non-destructive adjustment
layer. At the bottom of the layers panel click "Create New Fill or Adjustment
Layer" and select Hue / Saturation... This brings up the Hue and Saturation
dialog.

Then simply move the sliders until you get your desired color. Easy!

Here's a video of the whole thing so you can see how quickly it can be done.

Of course you could also use the Color Replacement Tool but I like this way!
