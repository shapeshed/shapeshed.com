## A disclaimer

Before I start I should note that I do not spit every time the word Microsoft is
mentioned. The advice I give to clients is purely based on the quality of
products and I am not running an agenda that Microsoft is bad whatever they do.

## Explaining browsers

I have learnt to assume that clients generally have no knowledge of the choice
they have in the browser market. It is normal for most clients to be using
Internet Explorer 6 or 7 and that this will be their only experience of using
the web. In proposals I list the browsers that will be supported on the project
and even when this is explicitly stated in proposals clients do not understand
that there is more than one browser in the market. Whether clients choose to
take my advice or not I see part of my job in a web project is to ensure clients
understand that there are different browsers in the market and what this means
for the end user.

## Explaining security

I have a real world example of a medium to large sized arts organisation whose
network was entirely compromised by using Internet Explorer 6. This was in part
down to the IT setup but according to the IT company who took over the contract,
would have been prevented via the use of Firefox. Through naive user actions a
virus compromised the network including financial data, and sensitive commercial
information. With Firefox being regularly updated for any security faults and
the fact that these patches are pushed immediately to users I recommend that IE6
networks switch to Firefox, or at very least upgrade to IE7. Following this
discussion several clients have switched the default browser they use within
their network.

## Explaining display

Clients do not understand that different browsers display sites in different
ways. It is relatively simple to point clients to examples where Internet
Explorer [underperforms other browsers][1], although I find it is more useful to
do this with the client. Explaining that some browsers are more capable of
understanding and presenting Javascript and CSS is hard work but well worth it.
I often discuss browser support by using the [Yahoo Graded Browser Support
Chart][2] and by using client data from Google Anaytics to show which browsers
are commonly being used in a similar industry. This discussion is not going to
drop support for IE6. But it will help clients to understand that IE6 has a poor
rendering engine compared to other browsers on the market.

## Product v. Market Share

Clients are often amazed that there such a clear disparity of product and market
share (this is still the case with IE7). In any transparent market, market share
is driven by cost and the quality of a product. With browsers there is no cost
so it is purely down to the quality of the product. It is clear however that on
display and security the market share does not reflect the quality of the
product. Every single client I have explained browsers to has understood the
presentation of facts and made their own conclusion. As I mentioned at the
beginning of this article I am not anti-Microsoft, I merely present the facts.
Opera are looking to do the same with their [antitrust action][3] against
Microsoft. Quite how this progresses will be very interesting as for me the
browser market is not transparent and users do not realise they have a choice.

## The browser market is broken

We have been through [Browser Wars][4] and I have no doubt we will continue to
see huge competition in the market. It is simple for me to explain the browser
market to clients. They understand the facts and make informed decisions. I
wonder though why this should be necessary? Through real world experience I
conclude that it is because clients do not understand they have a choice. In any
other industry in the UK the government would ensure this was not the case. All
I am looking for is a transparent and fair browser market where the best product
rises to the top. By any measure Microsoft has the worst product with the
biggest market share. This is an unsatisfactory situation for both users and the
web in general and one that I will continue to help my clients understand.
