## It should be easy

Picture the comfort of a living room, a glass of gin and tonic on the side table
and the prospect of a couple of hours buying presents for friends and family on
the internet. It should be so easy shouldn't it? Sadly experiences to date have
proved otherwise.

## Spoiling the Christmas cheer

Trying to buy some shampoo from the [Jo Malone website][1] proved a near
impossibility resulting in the whole thing being abandoned. Try buying anything
in Firefox on the site and you will note that the layout of key pages is broken
making it impossible to fill out information or purchase products.

## An unusable site in Firefox

Try [registering on the site][2]. I'm using [Firefox 2][3], a browser now used
by around 28% of users on the web according to the [W3C browser stats][4]. The
site is unusable as you cannot enter anything into the Verify Password section
as it overflows into the footer. Furthermore the Continue button is viewable but
not clickable.

## A major issue for online business

With Christmas being a key period for many online retailers this results in two
things. Firstly it results in irritated customers who are unlikely to return or
will take their business elsewhere. Secondly it results in lost income. Imagine
for example if shoppers could not get into a shop or make a purchase on Oxford
Street in London? It would be front page news. For the Jo Malone site they are
reducing the potential number of customers by 30%.

## Why does this happen?

Other than technically, I don't know why this has occurred on the Jo Malone site
but in my experience there are generally two issues. Firstly on the client side
there is often a very poor level of expertise. Even staff with Online in their
job title have little or no experience of the web. Secondly and more worryingly
internal or agency staff do not understand the medium they are working in. Cross
browser testing is a minimum requirement. The fact that it hasn't occured on the
Jo Malone site is an indication that something has gone horribly wrong and that
their market has just shrunk by 30%.

I'm sure that I won't be the only one to have a bad online experience this
Christmas. I've already taken my business elsewhere.
