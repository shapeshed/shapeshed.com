## What is the file command in UNIX?

The `file` command determines the file type of a file. It reports the file type
in human readable format (e.g. 'ASCII text') or MIME type (e.g. 'text/plain;
charset=us-ascii'). As filenames in UNIX can be entirely independent of file
type `file` can be a useful command to determine how to view or work with a
file.

## How to determine the file type of a file

To determine the file type of a file pass the name of a file to the
`file command`.The file name along with the file type will be printed to
standard output.

```sh
file file.txt
file.txt: ASCII text
```

To show just the file type pass the `-b` option.

```sh
file -b file.txt
ASCII text
```

The `file` command can be useful as filenames in UNIX bear no relation to their
file type. So a file called `somefile.csv` could actually be a zip file. This
can be verified by the `file` command.

```sh
file somefile.csv
somefile.csv: Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract
```

## How to determine the file type of multiple files

The `file` command can also operate on multiple files and will output a separate
line to standard output for each file.

```sh
file unix-*.md
unix-cat.md:         ASCII text, with very long lines
unix-comm.md:        ASCII text, with very long lines
unix-cut.md:         UTF-8 Unicode text
unix-exit-status.md: ASCII text
unix-file.md:        ASCII text, with very long lines
```

## How to view the mime type of a file

To view the mime type of a file rather than the human readable format pass the
`-i` option.

```sh
file -i file.txt
file.txt: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
```

This can be combined with the `-b` option to just show the mime type.

```sh
file -i -b file.txt
text/plain; charset=us-ascii
```

## How to view compressed files without decompressing

To view compressed files without decompressing them pass the `-z` option. In the
following example a file `foo.txt.gz` is a gzip compressed ASCII text file.

```sh
file -z bar.txt.gz
bar.txt.gz: ASCII text (gzip compressed data, was "bar.txt", last modified: Wed Sep  7 19:31:23 2016, from Unix)
```
