Tomorrow pebble {code} will host our first hackday! The theme is Olympics! The
IOC data is distinctly not open but there are some good feeds available.

### Food for developers

Who needs coffee, pizza and beer. We need data!

- [Transport for London](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/businessandpartners/syndication/default.aspx)
- [data.gov.uk](http://data.gov.uk/)
- [data.london.gov.uk](http://data.london.gov.uk/)
- [Streaming Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-api/methods)
- [Foursquare](https://developer.foursquare.com/index)
- [Open Street Map](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API_v0.6)
- YQL[8]

Some examples of what you might do with these are at
[MapTube](http://www.maptube.org/).
