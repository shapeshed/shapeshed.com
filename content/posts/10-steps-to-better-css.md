## Organise your stylesheets

How you divide up your stylesheets is very much a matter of personal choice. You
do however need to decide on how you organise your stylesheets. I use a slightly
modified veresion of the template that comes with [Andy Budd's][1] excellent
book [CSS Mastery][2]. This has author details at the top and clear delineation
of sections throughout. If your site is large one stylesheet may become
unmanageable so break it down into chunks and use @import to pull stylesheets
into the master.

## Use universal selectors

Knowing where you are starting from is very important. Often you will be
perplexed as to why padding has been applied by a particluar browser. For that
reason I like to remove padding, margins and borders from everything using a
universal selector. I then reapply padding, margins and borders to specific
elements and know exactly where I am starting from

```css
/* Remove padding and margin */
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  border: 0;
}
```

## Code defensively

The more you code CSS the more you will become aware of browser inconsistencies.
Take the double float margin bug in Internet Explorer 6 and below for example.
This is where a left float is placed within a container and a margin is applied
to the move it away from the left edge. IE gets it wrong and applies a double
margin. To combat this and the need to hack I like to apply margins to
everything within the left float rather than the float itself. This results in
consistent display across browsers. Note: Both examples assume the div is
floated left within a container.

Example one - applying the margin directly to the div. This will result in IE
misinterpreting it and probable hacking.

```css
#left-content {
  float: left;
  margin-left: 10px; /* This margin will be doubled in IE6 and below */
}
```

Example two - float the div left and then move everything in it away from the
edge by 10px using a universal selector. No hacking needed.

```css
#left-content {
  float: left;
}

#left-content * {
  margin-left: 10px;
}
```

## Avoid hacks

Hacking CSS is lazy and unless completely necessary should be avoided. With the
release of IE7 may old skool hacks will [cause problems][3]. If you encounter a
problem debug your CSS rather than hacking straight away. Understanding the
nature of the problem is key to improving your skills. Most of the time you will
be able to fix it without hacking. If you must hack put hacks in a separate
stylesheet and comment clearly.

## Use conditional stylesheets

If you have done more than 10 minutes of CSS you will realise that Internet
Explorer is the most buggy of all browsers. Thankfully you can use [conditional
comments][4] to manage the CSS that is served to IE. If I need it I have a
stylesheet called ie6_and_below.css that targets older versions of IE. It allows
me to manage CSS for older browsers quickly and easily.

```html
<!--[if lte IE 6]>
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="/css/ie6_and_below.css"
    type="text/css"
    media="screen"
  />
<![endif]-->
```

## Test, test, test

If you want to create robust CSS based layouts there is no way to avoid testing.
Begin by outlining the browsers you want to support. Then create a test
environment. Most browsers allow you to install multiple versions. For IE there
is a [handy .exe available][5] that will allow you to install multiple versions
on one OS. You will also need to test on a Mac. In fact I would recommend you
buy a Mac and use it as your primary machine.

## Comment your CSS

Almost every book ever written on coding advises commenting. Comments explaining
why and how you did something will make maintaining the CSS much easier.

```css
/*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    I use this for block comments
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

/* I use this for short commments */
```

## Read blogs

Stuffing your newsreader full of feeds is a great way to learn and develop. The
web is an industry that actively shares knowledge so take advantage of this. If
you find an interesting article or CSS fix through Google add the RSS feed to
your newsreader.

## Read the specs

If you really want to understand CSS there is no way of getting round reading
the CSS specification documents. The good news is they are all free. You will
learn a great deal from doing this so it is well worth it.

## Drink lots of tea

OK I'm English and I like drinking tea but there will be times when you simply
cannot fix a layout bug however hard you try. At this point it is a good idea to
put the kettle on. Relax, go and do something else and come back to it with
fresh eyes. You will often find that the solution will come very quickly after a
break.
