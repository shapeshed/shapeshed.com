## netrw - the unloved directory browser

The `netrw` plugin normally ships with vim and is the default filebrowser. It
gets a bad rap and ships with all kinds of features likes remote editing over
SSH and FTP, and anecdotally [has many bugs][3]. Most developers just jump
straight for the [`NERDtree` plugin][4] but in my opinion the default `netrw`
plugin does most of what people use `NERDtree` for. Moreover, for opening files
and traversing codebases there are other native vim options available.

## Invoking netrw

Invoking netrw can be achieved in three ways

- `:Explore` - opens `netrw` in the current window
- `:Sexplore` - opens `netrw` in a horizontal split
- `:Vexplore` - opens `netrw` in a vertical split

You can also snigger by typing `:Sex` to invoke a horizontal split.

## Changing the directory view in netrw

The directory listing view can be modified to show more or less information on
files and directories, change the sorting order and hiding certain files.

With the directory browser open hit `i` to cycle through the view types. There
are four different view types: thin, long, wide and tree. A preferred view type
can be made permanent by setting it in a `.vimrc` file.

```vim
let g:netrw_liststyle = 3
```

## Removing the banner

The directory banner is mostly useless. To remove it temporarily press `I`. To
remove it permanently add the following to your `.vimrc`.

```vim
let g:netrw_banner = 0
```

## Changing how files are opened

By default files will be opened in the same window as the netrw directory
browser. To change this behaviour the `netrw_browse_split` option may be set.
The options are as follows

- `1` - open files in a new horizontal split
- `2` - open files in a new vertical split
- `3` - open files in a new tab
- `4` - open in previous window

To make the selection permanent add the following to your `.vimrc`.

```vim
let g:netrw_browse_split = 1
```

## Set the width of the directory explorer

The width of the directory explorer can be fixed with the `netrw_browse_split`
option. The following sets the width to 25% of the page.

```vim
let g:netrw_winsize = 25
```

## NERDtree like setup

If NERDtree is your thing `netrw` can give you a similar experience with the
following settings

```vim
let g:netrw_banner = 0
let g:netrw_liststyle = 3
let g:netrw_browse_split = 4
let g:netrw_altv = 1
let g:netrw_winsize = 25
augroup ProjectDrawer
  autocmd!
  autocmd VimEnter * :Vexplore
augroup END
```

## My settings

I keep things minimal and am happy with most of the defaults. In fact for now I
just remove the banner. I told you I like minimal :-).

```vim
let g:netrw_banner = 0
```

## vim-vinegar

It is worth mentioning [vim-vinegar][7], a plugin that looks to enhance `netrw`
and is popular with users looking to avoid installing NERDtree.

> Well, vinegar.vim enhances netrw, partially in an attempt to mitigate the need
> for more disruptive "project drawer" style plugins.

In trying to use less vim plugins so I'm not a user but horses for courses etc.

## You may not need netrw

Vim also supports arbitrary commands to be run following `!`. For a quick
directory listing the following works.

```vim
:! ls -lF
```

For a more complex command other commands like `ack`, [`grep`][8] or [`find`][9]
can be used.

There are a number of ways to open files in vim and if that is what you use
`netrw` for. Using `find` within `vim` can open files and supports tab
completion.

```vim
:find path/to/file.txt
```

To open a file in a vertical split use the following. This also supports tab
completion.

```vim
:vs path/to/file.txt
```

To open a file in a horizontal split use the following. This also supports tab
completion.

```vim
:sp path/to/file.txt
```

To open a file in a new tab use the following. This also supports tab
completion.

```vim
:tabnew path/to/file.txt
```

For exploring codebases I also find [using `ctags`][10] is a better than
grepping or trying to guess where methods are defined. First you need to
generate a tags file using the `ctags` command.

```sh
ctags -R .
```

Once this file is created vim can take you to a function or method definition
automatically with `CTRL-]`. It is like magic and much more intelligent than
random file browsing.

## Conclusion

The directory browser that ships with vim is not particularly intuitive and
ships with a wealth of features I will most likely never use. I get the sense
that many developers just blindly install a shiny plugin without understanding
what `netrw` can do. Sure, `netrw` is not perfect but less dependencies in my
life and striving for simplicity is a good thing.
