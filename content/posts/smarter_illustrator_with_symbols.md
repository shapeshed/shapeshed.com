Why not [download the illustrator file][1] so you can work through this too?

Here's what we are going to end up with:

![Symbols in Illustrator][2]

## What symbols do

Symbols in illustrator allow you to save objects and illustrations so they can
be used again and again in your illustrations. Secondly they allow you to edit
the symbol in one place and for all occurrences of that symbol to be updated.
This can be a huge timesaver when a client asks you to change something at the
last minute. In the example below we are going to imagine that we are producing
a simple illustration for a client.

## Drawing your illustration

Firstly we will draw our illustration in the standard way. I've used the pen,
elipse and rotate tools to create a simple flower. Once I am happy with it
adding it to the symbol library is straightforward. Using the direct selection
tool I select all objects in the flower. Now go to Window > Symbols. This will
bring up the Symbols panel. Now drag the flower into the symbols panel. The
flower is now available as a symbol.

## Using symbols

Now you have the flower in your symbols you can start to use it. I've created a
background of some clouds, sky and grass. Incidentally I'm using symbols for the
clouds too. To add a symbol to the canvas there are two options. I can either
use Symbols Palette (Window > Symbols) and click the second icon from the left
"Place Symbol Instance". Note you will need to have an active layer for this to
work. Clicking this will place one instance of you symbol on the canvas.
Alternatively you can just drag the symbol from the Symbols Palette onto the
canvas.

![Using a symbol][5]

Another option is to use the Symbol Sprayer Tool. You will need to have selected
the symbol you want to use in the Symbols Palette by clicking on it. You can
tell it is selected as a small black border will appear. Then select the symbol
sprayer tool (Shift + S) and click and hold on the canvas. You will see that the
symbol is sprayed all over the place! You may not be happy with this but the
good news is you have a lot of control over how this works. Double click the
tool in the tools panel to bring up the options:

![Symbol Sprayer Tool Options][6]

You have control over all the aspects of this tool and it is probably a good
idea to have a play with them to understand what all the options are. So with
the options amended I've sprayed my symbol and ended up with this:

![Using the Symbol Sprayer][7]

A bit uniform. To break it up I use the rest of the tools within the Symbol
Sprayer Tool. Click and hold on the Symbol Sprayer Tool to see these options
come up. You can alter the rotation, size and distribution of the shapes.

Hopefully now you can see the power of symbols in allowing you quickly build
illustrations from a library of symbols.

## Efficient amends

The real beauty of symbols is that if a client asks for the an amend you can do
this very quickly. Let's say for example the client asks for the flowers to be
made orange. We would simply bring up the Symbols Window and then drag the
flower to the canvas. Double click the flower and Illustrator will notify you
you are about to edit the symbol definition. Click ok and you will be able to
edit the flower. You can do anything you like to the flower at this point. Once
you are happy with your work you will see an arrow in the top right hand corner
of the canvas which will return you to your picture and will update all
instances of the symbol. Imagine if you had had to do this to each individual
occurence of the flower.

## Building a library

Another bonus of symbols is that the more you work the more you will build up a
library of symbols allowing you re-use symbols on projects and save time. Maybe
you could go and lie on the beach instead...
