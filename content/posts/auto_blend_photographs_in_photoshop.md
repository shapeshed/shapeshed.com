## Two different photos

I have two different [Creative Commons][1] licensed photos from Flickr. The
first is [After the Rain][2] by [Julie La France ][3].

![Dark Clouds][4]

The second is [St Paul's Kirche][5] by [Joachim S. Muller][6]

![A Church in Sunlight][7]

## Combining the two

First lets open Julie's photo. For this to work it needs to be on a transparent
background. If you look in the layers panel you will see it is a Background
layer at the moment. So double click the layer and click ok. This turns it into
a normal layer with a transparent background. Then we want to enlarge the canvas
so the second image can fit. Go to Image > Canvas Size and double the height.
Then open the second image and drag it in. You should have something like this.

On the layer you have just pasted in lower the opacity by hitting four on the
keyboard. You can now position your second image. Once you are done crop off the
extra space using the crop tool.

Then bring the opacity back to 100% by hitting 0. Then in the layers palette
hold shift and select both layers. Make sure the background to both is blue
showing it is selected. Then go to Edit > Auto-Blend Layers. Photoshop does some
magic and you have blended your images.

As a side note for anyone in the UK I can throughly recommend [The Genius of
Photography][11]. The first episode was brilliant!
