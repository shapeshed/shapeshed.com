## Assigment 1A

Assigment 1A at the time of writing is still available [to download][1] from the
Stanford Site. It is very simple - to create a view with some text and an image
in it.

The assignment doesn't even need any code and can be created just using
Interface Builder.

## Creating the project

I'm just starting out so I'm going to list the steps for creating the project.

So we need to create a new project in Xcode. Launch Xcode and you'll see this
screen and we want 'Create a new Xcode Project'.

![Creating a new Xcode Project][3]

Then we need to chose the type of Project. In this case an iPhone OS application
and a 'Window Based Application'. I'm going to be creating a view with my
favorite comedian Les Dawson on so I called the application LesDawson.

## Working in Xcode

I'm a long term TextMate user so Xcode wasn't entirely unfamiliar. I chose to
change the theme to Dusk by going to Preferences > Fonts & Colors.

In terms of this assignment the file we want to edit is the MainWindow.xib file.
If you double click it Interface Builder will launch. This will bring up some
windows, but you'll want to make sure that you can see 'Window' and 'Library'.
If you can't see the 'Library' window go go to Tools > Library.

Now select the Library window. At the bottom is a settings icon. I found
changing the option to View Icons and Labels was more helpful to me. Then you
can just start to drag elements into the main window. I dragged a label into the
window and changed the text.

In the attributes window you can style the text. I added a shadow to the text.

## Adding a resource

I need to add an image so to do this you simply drag the image from your network
or filesystem into the resources folder. Make sure you check 'Copy items into
destination group's folder'. Now back in Interface Builder you can drag an Image
View into the window. Once you've done that you can edit the UIImageView's
properties and select the Image from the Image dropdown. You might need to set
the image size - you can do this under Image View Size. So you should be done
with Interface Builder, but don't forget to save by going to File > Save.

Now back in Xcode you can hit the 'Build and Run' button and you should see your
view launch in the Simulator.

## Source code

I've created a [Github repository][2] for these examples if it is useful to
anyone.
