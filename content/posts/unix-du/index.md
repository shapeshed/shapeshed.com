## What is the du command?

The `du` command is a command line utility for reporting file system disk space
usage. It can be used to find out disk usage for files and folders and to show
what is taking up space. It supports showing just directories or all files,
showing a grand total, outputting in human readable format and can be combined
with other UNIX tools to output a sorted list of the largest files of folders on
a system.

## How to view a disk usage summary of a directory

To view a disk usage summary of a directory pass the directory to the `du`
command. This will print a summary of the files and folders in a directory.

```sh
du ~/go
8       /home/george/go/src/gopkg.in/yaml.v2/.git/info
48      /home/george/go/src/gopkg.in/yaml.v2/.git/hooks
8       /home/george/go/src/gopkg.in/yaml.v2/.git/refs/heads
8       /home/george/go/src/gopkg.in/yaml.v2/.git/refs/remotes/origin
12      /home/george/go/src/gopkg.in/yaml.v2/.git/refs/remotes
1712    /home/george/go/src/gopkg.in/yaml.v2
1716    /home/george/go/src/gopkg.in
...
```

The output show the disk usage in kilobytes in the first column followed by the
full path to the file or folder. Folders are summaries so include a sum of files
and folders within them.

## How to view a grand total for a directory

To view a grand total for a directory pass the `-c` option. This will show the
full output and append a total line.

```sh
du -c ~/go
...
14420   /home/george/go/pkg
23088   /home/george/go/bin
170436  /home/george/go
170436  total
```

## How to view disk usage in human readable format

To view disk usage in human readable format pass the `-h` option. Instead of
showing file size in kilobytes for all files and folders the output is modified
to into a human readable format.

```sh
du -h ~/go
8.0K    /home/george/go/src/gopkg.in/yaml.v2/.git/info
48K     /home/george/go/src/gopkg.in/yaml.v2/.git/hooks
1.2M    /home/george/go/src/gopkg.in/yaml.v2/.git/objects/pack
1.2M    /home/george/go/src/gopkg.in/yaml.v2/.git/objects
```

## How to view the file size of a directory

To view the file size of a directory pass the `-s` option to the du command
followed by the folder. This will print a grand total size for the folder to
standard output.

```sh
du -s /home/george
2142628 /home/george
```

Along with the `-h` option a human readable format is possible.

```sh
du -sh /home/george
2.1G    /home/george
```

## How to sort by file or folder size

To sort by file size pass the output of `du` to `sort` and use the `-n`
(numeric) and `-r` (reverse) options.

```sh
du ~/go | sort -n -r | less
170440  /home/george/go
132816  /home/george/go/src
74024   /home/george/go/src/github.com
57072   /home/george/go/src/golang.org
```

## How to find the largest files or folders on a file system

To find the largest folders on a file system pass the `-a` option. This will
change the behaviour of `du` to write size counts for files as well as folders.
Run the following as root to see the ten largest files or folders on a system.
This can be useful if you are dealing with out of disk space issues on a system.

```sh
du -a / | sort -n -r | head -n 10
5351116 /
2462616 /usr
2153492 /home
2153472 /home/george
1571924 /usr/lib
```
