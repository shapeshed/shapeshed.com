## What we want to achieve

I want to have shapes or anything for that matter have a stroke but a
transparent fill. In Illustrator this would be easy but it requires a little
more effort in Photoshop. Here's an example:

![Transparent overlaps][1]

We want the shapes to overlap with a transparent centre but for them also to
have a stroke.

## The technique

First we draw the shape as normal. It doesn't really matter which colour you use
as this will be hidden. Now in the layers palette (Window > Layers) find the
layer for the shape you have drawn and right click on the layer. You will see
the following flyout menu. You want "Blending Options".

![Blending options][2]

This will bring up the layer style dialog box. Give the shape a stroke by
checking the Stroke box at the bottom. You can define the size of the stroke,
fill colour and a few other options here.

## Almost done

To complete the effect return to the layers menu. You will see the Fill option.
Click the flyout and reduce the percentage to 0%. This makes the fill
transparent giving us the effect we want to achieve.

![Opacity fill][4]

You can use this effect with any layer so if you have created a shape with the
pen tool this will also work. Now you can happily layer up your shapes with
transparent fills!
