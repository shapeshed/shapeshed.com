## Resizable text

![Resizable text][1]

Many sites continue to fix the size of fonts. Many users (including me) increase
font size if they are having difficulty reading the default font size. Setting
the default font size is a design issue but you should not be precious about
allowing users to resize your text.

## Write semantic XHTML

Writing semantic XHTML is a solid base for making your website more usable.
However a user decides to access your site, there will be a sound code base to
present the content. There are many PDAs and mobile phones that don't display
CSS files, or only display your rules partially. Using semantic code will help
the user to understand the site, as well as numerous other benefits.

## Write web friendly copy

Writing for the web is a different discipline than writing offline. Users read
less and scan content rather than read each line. Learning how to write for the
web is integral to good usability. Studies have shown usability is improved 124%
by understanding how users read on the web and writing for them.

## Avoid unnecessary link text

Link text should be descriptive but not meaningless. Phrases like "Click here"
and "Click here for more" don't help the user in what clicking the link will do
for them.

## Use a breadcrumb

Helping users to know where they are is a simple device to help them navigate
the site. Ensuring that the section names are links will also help users to
quickly get to where they want to go.

## Focus on forms

![Warning message][7]

Forms are a common area where users run into trouble. Structuring information in
a logical way, showing a progress bar and helping users to recover from errors
are all important points in improving usability.

## Print friendly pages

Print friendly pages are a simple enhancement that add real value to a site.
Many users like to print off articles. Using a print style sheet ensures the
article will look good when printed and won't drain print cartridges.

## Use focus groups

With the trend to launch sites in beta user group testing would seem to have
moved to the production environment. I still think there is a strong benefit in
testing sites before they are launched, even if the test group is relatively
small. Find a few users who match the target demographic of you site and ask
them to perform the key tasks on the site. It is likely that you will learn how
the site will be used and that usability as a whole will be improved.

## Provide a prominent search

![Search box][11]

Whether users are searching for a product or a information, providing a
prominent search box is an important means of improving usability. Many sites
continue to omit a search box however forcing the user to search through Google
and maybe losing them to other sites.

[Search and you may find - Jakob Nielsen][12]

## Embrace a user-centred design philosophy

Putting your users at the centre of the design and execution of your site will
lead to better results and a more usable website. Egos are out and the user is
king!
