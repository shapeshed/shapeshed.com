## What is RAW?

RAW is an image format produced by cameras. All cameras shoot in RAW. The
difference is that at the consumer end of the market most cameras convert the
RAW format instantly to a JPEG for you. At the higher end of the market however
you can access and manipulate the RAW image file. Many people like to think of
RAW as a the negative format for digital photography. The file contains all of
the information for the image but it needs to be processed before it can be
used. RAW contains information directly from the cameras image sensor, most of
which can be edited Photoshop.

## Why not shoot in JPEG?

For many people shooting in JPEG is the better option. The camera will interpret
the RAW image and convert it to a JPEG or TIFF. For casual photographers they
are not interested in manipulating each photograph.

If however you want more control over your image however you should choose the
RAW format. This will allows you to manipulate the image after it has been taken
exactly how you want to.

JPEG and TIFF files are gamma-compressed so you are likely to have less control
over lights and darks than if you use RAW. If you shoot in JPEG you have to
accept what the camera thinks is correct and rely on your Photoshop skills to
correct it.

In terms of a RAW file the settings that you can't change are [ISO speed][1] ,
[fStop][2] and [Shutter Speed][3]. Pretty much everything else you can
manipulate after the shot has been taken.

## Open JPEGs as RAW files

If you are using CS3 you can open JPEGs as RAW files via Adobe Bridge. Make sure
you take a copy of the file you are editing first as this is a destructive
method. Then right click the copy and choose Open in Camera Raw..

You can now edit the JPEG with all of the granularity that RAW offers. Pretty
cool. You can save it and maintain the information in the image by choosing the
DNG format.

## What is a DNG?

A DNG file is an open source file format created by Adobe. In a nutshell it is
an open source version of RAW. Many different versions of RAW exist for each
camera manufacturer and some parts of these files are encrypted to stop thrid
party software from accessing them. For extensibility this is a bad thing. DNG
is a great format and I'd love to see more of it but to date camera
manufacturers are keeping their doors shut.

## Editing RAW files in Photoshop

I'm going to leave it to the mighty Mike Mchugh to explain what you can do with
RAW files in Photoshop. I think "Bloody hell, wouldn't the bride be just pumped
with that?" says it all. If you are reading this in a newsreader you can [view
