for add-ons here is mine.

## Mostly ported

The good news is that the majority of my plugins have already been ported to EE
2.0 and will be available on launch date. You'll find the 2.0 ready versions
tagged as 2.x.x in the github repositories. 1.6.x releases are still available
as 1.x.x tags on the download page.

## Twit-ee

Twit-ee is a bigger add-on and I would like to devote further time to the add-on
before releasing it for EE2.0. I have thought long and hard about whether to
charge for Twit-ee and I have decided that for EE2.0 I will begin charging for
this add-on. This will allow me to add more features and provide proper support
for users.

My goal is to add a full feature set for the features available in the API and
to produce an enterprise level add-on that will fully integrate Twitter with
ExpressionEngine. Pricing will be announced nearer the time. EE 1.6.x users can
continue to use the free 1.6.x version but support and development (other than
critical bug fixing) will cease at the 1.4 release.

## Support

For free add-ons these continue to come with no support, but anyone is welcome
to fork and develop the free add-ons under the terms of their licenses.

## Exciting times ahead

I'm really excited by the pending arrival of ExpressionEngine 2.0 and with that
the arrival of many, many talented developers from the CodeIgniter community.
