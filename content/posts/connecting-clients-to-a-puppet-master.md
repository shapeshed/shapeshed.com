## Overview

Following on from a [previous post][1] where I outlined how to set up a Puppet
Master server we are now going to look at how to connect a client to the Puppet
Master and start to manage the client server. This walkthrough is based on two
Ubuntu 10.04.2 LTS servers.

## Assumptions

For the purpose of this walkthrough I'm going to assume you have a working
Puppet Master server as outlined in the [previous post][1]. I'm also assuming
that you have a client server and that you have either have DNS set up of that
you have amended the hosts files of each server so that each can ping the other
by hostname. If you are using hosts files your /etc/hosts files should look
something like this

```sh
192.168.3.162 puppetmaster.example.com puppetmaster puppet
192.168.3.165 puppetclient.example puppetclient
```

## Connect client to server

Once we can ping each server make sure the Puppet Master is running

```sh
sudo puppet master
```

Then we can connect from the client to the server

```sh
puppet agent --server puppetmaster --waitforcert 60 --test
```

You should see

```sh
info: Creating a new SSL certificate request for puppetclient
```

Now on the server we can see the request that has come in with

```sh
puppet cert --list
```

You should see 'puppetclient'. Now we can sign the certificate with

```sh
puppet cert --sign puppetclient
```

The first time I did this I encountered [an issue][2] that complained that the
hostname did not match the server certificate. This can be resolved by setting
this explicitly in /etc/puppet/puppet.conf

```sh
[master]
    certname=puppetmaster
```

Now you should have both servers talking to each other and everything configured
to start configuring the client with the Puppet Master. After a minute or so you
should see the puppet client cache the certificate - this shows that everything
is ok.

## Adding a module

Now you can start building modules to be sent to the client server. I started
with a module to change the message of the day banner. You can find it [on
github][3]. Once you've added your new module restart puppet.

Then you can send modules to nodes that you manage. In
/etc/puppet/manifests/nodes.pp add this

```sh
node puppetclient {
  include motd
}
```

When the client requests an update from the server it will be sent the new
configuration and the motd will be updated.

The Puppet documentation has some [good documentation][4] on creating manifests.
