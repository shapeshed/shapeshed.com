## Final cross browser test

Perhaps the most important check a final cross browser check is completed once
content and images are in. Often during content entry HTML can be poorly formed.
Checking again against your agreed browser list ensures the site will display
consistently at launch.

## Validate code

I validate code at the template stage but I also like to complete a further
validation check before site launch. At this stage the errors found a minimal
but it is a final quality assurance check. You can check your HTML [here][1] and
your [CSS here.][2] Validating code is good for many reasons but it will ensure
search engine spiders can deep crawl your site at the earliest opportunity.

## Check links

You can guarantee that somewhere in your site there will be a broken link. There
are many link checkers out there but if your site isn't too big you can validate
an entire site at the [WDG HTML Validator][3]. This will point out any broken
links as well as any code errors.

## Site features

Somewhere along the line I always seem to forget something. So I check the
following features are in place for launch.

404 page

Making sure a bespoke 404 page is in place and configured on the server. This
will help users recover from errors and will help search engines keep indexes up
to date.

Print friendly CSS file

A print friendly CSS file is a simple but valuable addition to a site. There is
a great print CSS tutorial [here][4] and it is a simple addition that will
enhance usability.

Google Sitemap XML file

Creating an [XML sitemap file][5] is a simple way of helping Google to spider
content. Many Content Management Tools allow you to create XML files, or you can
use an [online sitemap creator][6] to do it for you.

Google Analytics

Ensuring you add [Analytics code][7] to your site will allow you and your client
to track the success of your site. It is easily forgotten but ensuring it is set
up and configured for your client to access is crucial.

robots.txt

If there are areas of the site you don't want to be spiders you should ensure
that a [robots.txt][8] file is in place and on the server. If you forget and go
live without your content may well get spidered.

These are simple features that should be on every professional site.

## Generating free traffic

It is well known that Google doesn't like island sites - that is to say sites
that don't have any links from other sites. You can easily generate links by
submitting your site to [CSS][9] [Galleries][10] and exchanging links with other
sites. If you get into one of the CSS galleries it is likely you will get a good
amount of traffic, and this will encourage Google to deep crawl your site more
quickly. Submitting your site to search engines is a good idea too. Most major
search engines have a manual submission form.

## Anything else?

What do you do? Do you have a checklist when you launch a site? Or do you just
do these things by habit?
