<div class="description">

<p>Eric Meyer is seen by many as the James Brown of CSS. A Godfather who was doing it before it was trendy; the hardest working man in CSS. He has written extensively on CSS and continues to work for the adoption of web standards. As such I was keen to get hold of one of his early books. Cascading Style Sheets - The Definitive Guide was first published in 2000 when most web developers were still stuck in tables and font tags. It is a book that goes through the technical side of CSS in some detail.</p>

<p>In fact the book is more of an explanation of the CSS Specification and for that reason alone it is worth reading. Meyer certainly knows his stuff and despite thinking I have a reasonable grasp of CSS, I learnt a great deal from reading this book. Meyer goes through Selectors to Non-Screen Media in a comprehensive tour of CSS and how it works.</p> 

<p>A harsh and perhaps unfair criticism of such a visionary book is that it lacks practical examples. This book was written before CSS was widely adopted so it is no surprise that the book is more of a manual than a toolkit. Comparing the book to <a href="http://www.cssmastery.com/">CSS Mastery</a> by Andy Budd for example the reader will find much less technical detail in Budd's book but more practical application of CSS and what it can do.</p> 

<p>This should not detract from encouraging you to read the book however, whether you are a beginner of an expert. It is also a book that I would reach for if I had a query about a technical aspect of CSS. The book is certainly more accessible and offers better explanations than the CSS 2.1 spec.</p> 

<p>To summarise Cascading Style Sheets - The Definitive Guide is a visionary book that is a worthy read. The text is at times dense and for beginners may be daunting. But everyone will find something new here, although it likely to be a technical detail of CSS rather than a helpful technique.</p>
