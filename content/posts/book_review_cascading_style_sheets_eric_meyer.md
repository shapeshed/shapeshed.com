Eric Meyer is seen by many as the James Brown of CSS. A Godfather who was doing
it before it was trendy; the hardest working man in CSS. He has written
extensively on CSS and continues to work for the adoption of web standards. As
such I was keen to get hold of one of his early books. Cascading Style Sheets -
The Definitive Guide was first published in 2000 when most web developers were
still stuck in tables and font tags. It is a book that goes through the
technical side of CSS in some detail.

In fact the book is more of an explanation of the CSS Specification and for that
reason alone it is worth reading. Meyer certainly knows his stuff and despite
thinking I have a reasonable grasp of CSS, I learnt a great deal from reading
this book. Meyer goes through Selectors to Non-Screen Media in a comprehensive
tour of CSS and how it works.

A harsh and perhaps unfair criticism of such a visionary book is that it lacks
practical examples. This book was written before CSS was widely adopted so it is
no surprise that the book is more of a manual than a toolkit. Comparing the book
to [CSS Mastery](http://www.cssmastery.com/) by Andy Budd for example the reader
will find much less technical detail in Budd's book but more practical
application of CSS and what it can do.

This should not detract from encouraging you to read the book however, whether
you are a beginner of an expert. It is also a book that I would reach for if I
had a query about a technical aspect of CSS. The book is certainly more
accessible and offers better explanations than the CSS 2.1 spec.

To summarise Cascading Style Sheets - The Definitive Guide is a visionary book
that is a worthy read. The text is at times dense and for beginners may be
daunting. But everyone will find something new here, although it likely to be a
technical detail of CSS rather than a helpful technique.
