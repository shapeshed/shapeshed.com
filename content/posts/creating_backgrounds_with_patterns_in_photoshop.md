## Using patterns

Using custom patterns is a great way to fill large areas. Open up a new document
of 12 x 12 and select the pencil tool. Draw a pattern that will repeat. Here's
the one that I've drawn.

To convert it to a pattern go to Edit > Define Pattern. Now create a new
document that will be used to create the background. I've created mine at 500
x 300. Create a new layer with a solid fill. My colour here is #ff0099.

## Building the background

Now right click on the layer and choose "Blending Options". You will see the
Layer style dialogue come up. Click Pattern Overlay. In the middle you will be
able to click and select the pattern you have just added. Change the blend mode
at the top to Overlay. You can play with the Opacity and Scale if you like too.

Then click on the Gradient Overlay option. Select the standard Black to White
Gradient and choose Screen for Blend Mode. Play with the opacity until you are
happy. I stopped at 57%.

Within a couple of minutes you can quickly build up a background that stands out
from a standard solid fill.
