## What is the comm command in UNIX?

The `comm` command compares two sorted files line by line and writes three
columns to standard output. These columns show lines that are unique to files
one, lines that are unique to file two and lines that are shared by both files.
It also supports suppressing column outputs and comparing lines without case
sensitivity.

## How to compare the compare two files line by line

To compare two files line by line using `comm` it is a prerequisite that files
are first sorted. For this example we will be comparing two files with numbers
in that are saved as `set1.txt` and `set2.txt`. The following is the contents of
`set1.txt`.

```sh
1
2
3
```

The following is the contents of `set2.txt`.

```sh
8
3
2
```

As theses files are not sorted [sort][3] can be used to accomplish this

```sh
comm <(sort set1.txt) <(sort set2.txt)
1
2
3
8
```

The output is in three columns. The first is lines that are only in file one
(`set1.txt`), the second is lines only in file two (`set2.txt`), the third is
line that are in both files.

## How to show specific comparisons

To show specific comparisons using `comm` pass the option of the column that
should be suppressed. In the following example only column three, or the lines
that are common to both files are shown.

```sh
comm -12 <(sort set1.txt) <(sort set2.txt)
2
3
```

The following example shows lines that are unique to `set1.txt`.

```sh
comm -23 <(sort set1.txt) <(sort set2.txt)
1
```

The following example shows lines that are unique to `set2.txt`.

```sh
comm -13 <(sort set1.txt) <(sort set2.txt)
8
```

## How to ignore case sensitivity

To ignore case sensitivity when using `comm` pass the `-i` option. This will
ignore case sensitivity in the comparison. Consider the two following files that
have been sorted.

```sh
cat words1.txt
Apple
Banana
Orange
```

```sh
cat words2.txt
apple
banana
orange
```

If these files are compared using `comm` there will be nothing common to these
two files.

```sh
comm words comm words1.txt words2.txt
Apple
Banana
Orange
apple
banana
orange
```

If case sensitivity is ignore with `-i` option the words will be shown as common
to both files. Note that the uppercase words is shown as it is from the first
file.

```sh
comm -i words1.txt words2.txt
Apple
Banana
Orange
```
