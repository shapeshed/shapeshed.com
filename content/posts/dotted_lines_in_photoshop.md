## No dotted line preset

It is a little surprising that no dotted line preset exists in Photoshop - even
in CS3. It is easy enough to do though but requires a bit of tweaking to get the
desired effect. This is what we want to acheive. It is a one pixel dotted line
that will appear under links.

## Getting the effect

To create this you first need to select the pencil tool (seeing as we want the
edges of the dots to be square). In the brushes options click on the arrow to
the right of the brush to bring up the brushes library. You should see the
Master Diameter and Hardness as well as the brushes below. Click on the flyout
arrow to the right of Master Diameter and you should see the following:

![Duplicate the brush][2]

Click new brush preset and give your brush a name. I've called mine "Link 1px
Dotted Line". Now bring up the brushes palette by going to Window > Brushes.
Click Brush Tip Shape and then change Spacing to 200%. This will give you a 1px
dotted line.

Now with the Pencil tool selected you can draw dotted lines onto the canvas.
