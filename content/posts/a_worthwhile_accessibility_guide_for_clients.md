A [previous journal][1] entry outlines the benefits of building an accessible
site and this guide proves that with real figures.

A presentation given at the launch of the publication gave the following figures
on the Legal and General site after it had been made accessible:

- 30% increase in natural search engine traffic
- Significant improvements in our rankings in google for all target keywords
- 75% reduction in time to load a page
- Browser compatibility - 13,000 visitors per month effected. not a single
  complaint
- Accessible using PDA's, Mobiles, Blackberry and other hand held devices
- Speed/Effort required to manage content reduced from and average of 5 days to
  0.5 days per job

This is nothing new to web developers. The benefits of building accessible sites
have been known to many for a while. What is good is that this document begins
to allow decision makers to understand why accessibility matters.

There are countless web developers and agencies around but by choosing one with
a commitment to web standards you can be sure that the site will perform well
once it is launched. It also ensures that the quality of the code will be what
you are expecting.

I would welcome and indeed pay for a quality mark administered by the Disability
Rights Commission or the RNIB to accredit Digital Design Agencies. This document
is a start as it will allow clients to ask the right questions and hopefully
find competent, standards compliant Agencies.
