## Yahoo Query Language

If you haven't seen the [Yahoo Query Language][1] you should definitely check it
out. It has a [handy console][2] where you can test queries and for anyone who
writes SQL on a regular basis it should be pretty straight forward to construct
a query and see the results that you get. It will even generate the REST query
for you to drop into your scripts, outputting a choice of XML or JSON. You can
look through the many APIs that Yahoo offer including Flickr, Upcoming.

## A supra-API

Any developer who uses APIs on a regular basis knows that understanding and
interrogating APIs is made more difficult by that fact that no standards exist
for methods and syntax within APIs. YQL pulls together APIs to allow you to
interrogate a variety of APIs through a standardised language. Yahoo call this
YQL but for all intents and purposes it is SQL. So to query Flickr for photos of
London that are geotagged you could use.

```sh
select * from flickr.photos.search where has_geo="true" and text="london"
```

This generates the REST query

```sh
    %}http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select%20*%20from%20flickr.photos.search%20where%20has_geo%3D%22true%22%20and%20text%3D%22london%22&format=xml
```

You can use this to get data however you like - JavaScript, CLI, PHP or
whichever server-side language you prefer.

## Adding semantic markup

Adding Microformats adds a rich layer of semantic information to this supra-API.
YQL [supports joins][3] so already we can create views of data from multiple
sites using this service. Welcome to "View Source" your way for data.

## Why this is good

When I started working on the web six years ago I thought of the web as a giant
fileserver that was grossly underused in terms of access to data. In recent
years I've realised that it is actually a giant network that can read, write and
learn from other nodes. APIs have emerged as an initial way to share data
between sites but for this to truly emerge, we need a standard means of sharing
data and ultimately of granting permissions. The web community have worked
through, and are still working through standards in client side technologies,
but APIs are still at the beginning. YQL should be commended for using
technologies that work very well on a local network to apply them to the
internet in general. I for one can't wait to get hacking with Microformats in
the YQL. More reason that you should [start using Microformats][4].
