## What is progressive enhancement?

[Progressive Enhancement][1] is nothing new. It is a design philosophy that the
core features of a site should work for everyone on an agreed range of browsers.
The site is then progressively enhanced for more capable browsers. The idea is
that users with better browsers will get a better experience, but users with
less capable browsers will still be able to use the site. This also echoes a key
driver of the web standards philosphy - ensuring access for all.

## Javascript Example

[Here's a simple example][2] of Progressive Enhancement in action. With
Javascript enabled users don't need a page refresh. Without it users do. Both
users ultimately get the same thing but users with Javascript get a better
experience than those without. This has additional benefits of being search
engine friendly and accessible. For further reading there are some great
articles on this on [Christian Heilmann's site][3].

## CSS Example

Let's take a classic example. We want to curve the edges of a box. We could use
one of a [myriad of CSS techniques][4] or even [one][5] of [many][6] Javascript
solutions. You can also use the CSS3 property border-radius. So which one should
you use?

I am going to get off the fence and (with the philosophy of Progressive
Enhancement) say use border-radius. Why? It is supported by Firefox (over a
[third of the market][7]) using -moz-border-radius and also Safari using
-webkit-border-radius. It will result in faster loading times, be more
maintainable and result in a better experience for those who have capable
browsers. For those without support for border radius they will not get rounded
corners. Do I care about this? No - not really. Will my client care? Yes - and
that's the problem.

## Admitting all users aren't the same

Let's use an analogy of a car driving from A to B. If I am in a very expensive
car I am likely to get from A to B in comfort and probably have satellite
navigation available to me. If I am in a cheaper car I am likely to get from A
to B in slightly less comfort and I may have to use a map. Both cars get from A
to B but one passenger has a better experience than the other. The analogy
between cars and browsers stops here however because browsers are free. They
don't cost anything.

If users choose to browse a site with a less capable browser I'm certainly going
to make sure they can use it. But I don't care if they get a lesser experience.
That is their choice. Giving individuals choice is fundamental to a free market
and free markets create better products. I respect every user's right to access
and use a website, but I also acknowledge their choice. If that choice is a less
capable browser then I have no issue with them getting a lesser experience. The
philosophy of giving all users the same experience is in my opinion a false one.

## The battleground

Of course this is all great in theory until your client asks why the site does
not look the same in all browsers. They don't care about browsers - they just
want the site to look the same in the other 60% of the market. At this point you
are faced with a clear choice. You can continue to hack and use less than
optimal code to fix less capable browsers or you can explain Progressive
Enhancement to your client. Of course it is the client who pays the bills so
they have the final say. But in future I will be explaining this to clients. I
suspect I will lose more battles than I win.

My design and development philosophy has changed however. I'm no longer going to
strive to make everything the same in less capable browsers.
