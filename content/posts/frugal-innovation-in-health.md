On 18th February 2016 I attended the [Global Health Forum][17] session at
Imperial College, London on Frugal Innovation. Here are my notes on a
fascinating afternoon.

## Dr Yasser Bhatti

### What are Frugal Innovations?

Reverse and frugal innovation is primarily concerned with the BRIC (Brasil,
Russia, India, China) countries but also the next 11 and then the next 25. These
emerging markets are transitioning toward becoming developed countries and are
have markets that will grow very quickly. These countries commonly face three
challenges:

- Resource constraints
- Market affordability
- Institutional voids or complexities

These countries often lack hard and soft institutions. Hard institutions mean
things like roads, ports, sanitation. Soft institutions means things like
effective governments, the rule of law. With all of this opportunity a lot of
businesses are looking to sell into emerging markets. An example of a newly
minted entrepreneur is shown who buys a Mercedes but then has to drive it on a
dirt road. This is seen as an example of how institutions are often not in place
for products from the west to function.

These constraints often fuel innovation. [Ratan Tata][10] is an entrepreneur who
noticed that most people ride around on mopeds or rickshaws and that often
includes 5 people. He set the goal of an affordable car and invented the Tato
Nano Car. This is seen as an example of frugal innovation and is documented in
the book [Nanovation - How A Little Car Can Teach The World To Think Big][1].
Another example is [Muhammad Yunus][5] and his approach to Microfinance for
groups of women.

The challenge and academic interest is how can you do more with less for many
more people. A exemplar project is shown in [Remotion][6], a high performance
knee joint for developing world amputees. They looked at high performance US
knee joints or the [Jaipur Knee][7] and wanted to produce high quality but at
low cost. They came up with $80 high quality knee joint. This is seen as an
example of reverse innovation where potentially an innovation driven by
constraints can be sold into developed markets.

The next example is [Peek Vision][9] who took the [Aravind Eye Care System][11]
and used it to innovate. The video give a good flavour for the product.

The final example given is [Robohand][12], a 3D Printed alternative to
traditional prosthetics. The creator also made the designs open source.

## Mr Matt Prime

Matt is Orthopedic Surgeon who spent a year working in Malawi and talked of how
the country has a GDP of $1 billion. He notes that Imperial College Healthcare
has a budget of $1 billion. Malawi has a population of 15 million. With Malawi
having far less resources people innovate. He himself found that surgical drills
were in scarce supply and at $30,000 a drill it was not possible to buy one.
Instead he took a normal drill from B&Q put it in a bag, tied it up and used
that. He notes there is a big price discrepancy between medical grade products
and consumer products that can do the same thing.

There are different drivers on Healthcare depending on the economy.

### High income

- Ageing populations
- Burden of chronic disease
- Exponential cost

### Low income

- Establishing healthcare systems
- Lack of infrastructure
- Lack of resources

But for both of these models frugal innovation needs to

- Decrease the cost of care
- Widening the access of care

The example of GE's Mac 400 ECG is given as frugal innovation. GE's [Healthy
Imagination][9] is designed to give high quality and affordable products in
healthcare. At the beginning of the century GE turned its focus onto emerging
economy, mainly because the market size is three times as big as Western Europe.
For the GE Mac 400 they decided to strip back the product to what really
mattered. They took a queue from bus tickets and used a cheap printer to print
out results.

Matt's research identified the following products were identified as Frugal
Innovations:

- [Arbutus Drill Cover](http://arbutusmedical.ca/)
- [eACCESS](http://www.access-health.org/)
- [Fosmo Med](http://fosmomed.com/)
- [JANMA](http://www.kopernik.ngo/technology/janma-clean-birth-kit)
- [Miroculus](http://miroculus.com/)
- [Mothers Delivery Kit](http://www.motherskit.com/)
- [Peek Vision](http://www.peekvision.org/)
- [Possible](http://healthmarketinnovations.org/program/possible-health)
- [Pro Mujer](http://promujer.org/)
- [Pumani BCPAP](http://hadleighhealthtechnologies.com/pumani-bcpap/)
- [Robohand](http://www.robohand.net/)
- [Smile Train](http://www.smiletrain.org/)
- [Ziqitza](http://www.ziqitza.com/)
- [BRACI Smart Ear](http://www.braci.co/)
- [Sughavazhvu Healthcare](http://sughavazhvu.co.in/)

## Mr Matthew Harris

Matthew asked the question is it a level playing field? There is lots of
innovation but very little adoption. To what extent are the barriers exacerbated
by moving from low to high income? He notes the term reverse innovation is
problematic and he sees it as a development issue. He notes it is hard to
identify innovations that have been developed by people in low income countries.

Matthew has engaged with senior clinicians around adopting the [Brazilian Family
Strategy][13]. In the NHS there are a plethora of different HCPs delivering
different parts. He identified a wide array of people all operating in a
fragmented way. Brazil organises differently. Small teams of GP, Nurse and
community health workers live where they work. Community health workers visit
every month and will deliver Primary Care Interventions. This is a very
efficient model and as they tessellate it scales well.

Matthew presented some reactions to the proposal.

### Reactions

- What can we possibly learn from a country like Brazil?
- Does it even have a health system?
- Brazil is much more friendly and community focused.

### Non sequiturs

- No evidence that a pilot project would work.
- We couldn't afford it if it worked.
- Lets start by focusing on high risk groups like diabetes.

Matthew noted that there is an idea that good watches come from Switzerland and
not Rwanda. There is evidence that of a product leads to 30% of your view of it.
It might be the same product but the source matters.

Interested by this Matthew ran a survey where he changed the source of medical
research that had been independently verify. He changed the sources where one
from a high income country and another one from a low one. He wanted to test on
strength of evidence and whether it they would refer it to whether it they would
refer it to a colleague.

He found that on strength of evidence they were not influenced. For referral to
a peer they were more likely to refer it to a peer if the research was from a
developed country. Using an implicit association test he showed that on average
people consider good research to come from rich countries and poor research from
poor countries.

## Ms Maja Kecman

Maja is a designer from the [Helix Centre][18], the only design studio based in
a hospital. They are outward focused and take a collaborative approach to
projects. They focus on frugal innovations and have unprecedented access to the
healthcare environment.

### What is design?

Design is the process and thinking. It is the rapid iteration of different
solutions. The example of TongueSucker is shown as an example of rapid
prototyping and testing. It is a way of clearing the airway of an unconscious
person. A series of prototyping are shown and Maya talks of lots of thinking and
iterations go into the final product.

Maja gives another example of the birthday card that you get from the NHS on
your 60th Birthday. This tells you that you are at increased risk of bowel
cancer and invites you to poo on a stick. Unsurprisingly the uptake is very low.
The Helix Centre have redesigned this card and message and are taking it forward
to see if uptake can be improved through simple design and copy changes.

Maja gives another example of non-attendance of appointment through [differently
worded SMS reminders][15]. In the NHS 20% of appointments are missed which is
extremely costly to the service. By simply changing the wording of the SMS this
was improved. This is cited as an example of Zero Cost Innovation.

![Clinical Appointments Missed](/images/articles/results.jpg)

Maja showed [Floot][16], an app they working on in relation to Asthma. The app
encourages patients to blow into a peak flow whistle. Doctors held that kids
wouldn't blow into a peak flow whistle but the app shows they will if
incentivised in the right way.

They are also going to use the Apple healthkit to gather data during the trial.

## Conclusion

In attending the event I learned a huge amount. It was great to understand some
of the academic research going into frugal innovation as well as to be shown
some of the practical applications. In the world of technology innovation frugal
innovation maps well to our idea of hacking. I gained new perspective that
solutions do not need to be complex and that often very small changes can make
huge differences.
