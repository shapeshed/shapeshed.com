## The process

Firstly and most importantly get all stakeholders together and consider your
audience:

- Who are they?
- What do they expect?
- What are the most important functions they need to perform on the site?
- What do we want them to do on the site?

Write the answers to these questions down and refer to them when you are
discussing ideas.

## Keep things simple

Most sites entail users performing two or three core tasks. Over complicating
things will frustrate users and will move them on elsewhere. It is better to do
a few things well than lots of things badly.

Secondly consider your branding. Will your existing branding work online? Do you
have a design brief? You can contract someone to do this for you but if you have
strong feelings about how it should look you should discuss and document this
now.

Thirdly you should agree on how to measure success. The Internet is here for the
long term so decide on what you want to achieve and how you are going to track
it. Are you going to measure your success by number of hits, the number of
customers acquired through the site or something else altogether?

Fourthly be prepared to adapt the brief with any agency that you choose.
Agencies should challenge your brief and bring new ideas to the table. But
having your ideas and aspirations on paper will help them to know what you want
and how they can help you.

Finally ensure that the decisions taken are accepted internally. A strategy that
changes five minutes after it was written is doomed to failure.

## Documenting your strategy

How you document your strategy is up to you. But having a document you can refer
to will help you keep focus on what you are trying to achieve.

A rough structure that has worked in the past is:

- Audience profile
- What the audience need to be able to do
- What you want the audience to do
- Branding
- Budget
- Measuring success
- Date to review this strategy

Assigning a budget can be difficult. If you are in any doubt use your initial
requirements to gather some quotes. Agencies generally won't charge for a quote
and this will help you understand what you can get for your money.

Finally set a review date for your strategy. Generally a good time to review
things is about six months after the launch of a new site and three months after
a re-launch. Get your agency involved and assess what has gone well and what
could be improved.

If you have been through this process you will give yourself and your business a
head start over your competitors, many of whom will not have any strategy at all
