## Learning Javascript

I'm going to be writing a series of articles in which I outline my experiences
of learning Javascript. I am not an expert and specifically I'm a beginner with
a good background in standards based CSS and XHTML who wants to learn modern
Javascript. So if you don't understand something leave a comment, and if you are
an expert then please chip in. Hopefully this will help others to start learning
these skills.

## Getting the philosophy

Just like Web Standards for XHTML and CSS, learning Javascript is much easier if
you grasp some underlying principles. The first is Graceful Degradation. This
means that whilst you use all of the great things that Javascript brings it is
important that the site still functions on older browsers and / or with certain
options turned off. From an XHTML and CSS stance an example of this would be
adding alt tags. If images are turned off then users get the alt text.

This goes hand in hand with Progressive Enhancement. Progressive Enhancement is
meant to sound the death of Graceful Degradation but in fact the two are very
similar. Progressive Enhancement means that users with modern, capable browsers
get a better and more rich experience than users on older browsers. So someone
with a really old browser will get a sparce HTML page whilst someone with the
latest browser will get all the bells and whistles. Progressive Enhancement is
comfortable with that, serving a richer experience to users who can handle it.

What both of these philosophies have in common is the separation of markup from
style and keeping Javascript out of the markup. Starting with valid, semantic
and clean markup will mean you can follow either route.

For me Graceful Degradation is a half empty glass, whilst Progressive
Enhancement is half full. They are both similar in what they are looking to
achieve - a working site for all users.

## Old methods - Javascript in the document

At this point you might want to [view the example][1] or [download the source
code][2]

This might seem very familiar to front end developers who have made the
transition to CSS. Historically Javascript was placed in the markup, just like
font tags. Javascript was in between the body tags, it was in links, it was in
onclick events.

```html
<a onclick="oldJS(); return false;" href="#">old school javascript</a>
<a onclick="javascript: oldJS(); return false;" href="#"
  >more old school javascript</a
>
<a href="javascript: oldJS();">yet more old school javascript</a>
```

This is bad for a number of reasons: accessibility, browser support, maintenance
and the fact that it causes real problems when javascript is turned off. It can
cause search engine spiders to stop indexing a page too if there are javascript
errors.

## The modern method - use the DOM

If you are a CSS coder then you are probably familiar with the DOM. This is the
Document Object Model. You probably use it to create rules and access elements
within the document for your CSS. The good news is that if you understand it
Javascript gives you more flexibility to find, create, amend and delete elements
within your document. And all without going back to the server or using an AJAX
call. If you don't understand it there is a short tutorial from a CSS
perspective [available here.][3]

Using the DOM we can find a link with the id "good-js" and do something with it.
In this case we will attach an onclick event to it.

```js
function modernJS() {
  // Check the browser supports getElementById so we can find our link
  if (!document.getElementById) {
    return;
  }

  // Find the trigger link with the DOM. This looks for the id good-js
  var goodJs = document.getElementById("good-js");

  // If it isn't there return
  if (!goodJs) {
    return;
  }

  // We've made it here so a link with with the id good-js exists. Wait for onclick and do something
  goodJs.onclick = function () {
    alert("That's better isn't it. No need to make the markup dirty!");
    return false;
  };
}
```

## Attaching the function to onload

Adding the function to the onload event is basically getting it ready for when
the user triggers it with the event. In this case it is an onclick, but it needs
to be ready when the page loads.

Traditionallly window.onload was used but this wasn't perfect so a number of
onload scripts have been created. Most Javascript libraries have scripts that
handle onload. Simon Willison wrote [a short script][4] that seems to do the
trick.

```js
function addLoadEvent(func) {
  var oldonload = window.onload;
  if (typeof window.onload != "function") {
    window.onload = func;
  } else {
    window.onload = function () {
      if (oldonload) {
        oldonload();
      }
      func();
    };
  }
}

addLoadEvent(modernJS);
```

You will see that we have asked the function to load in the modernJS function
when the page loads. So everything is ready.

## The markup

Using the DOM and onload we can keep our markup clean and lean. It also means
that if Javascript is turned off then the user is taken through to alternative
content rather going nowhere.

```html
<a id="good-js" href="non_js_content.html">The modern way of doing it</a>
```

So when a user with Javascript clicks the link the modernJS function is fired.
If they don't have Javascript they will be taken to another page. So it is good
for all users, search engines and accessibility. We have separated our markup
and Javascript and hopefully you can see why this is important.

If you've made it this far you can [download the source code][2] or [view the
example][1]

## Join the fun

OK - you could go out and grab a Javascript library. But isn't it time you
started learning what was really going on? If you disagree with anything written
here please leave a comment. This is meant to help people learn.
