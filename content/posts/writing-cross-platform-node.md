## Cross-platform if you want

Node.js is cross-platform meaning it works on Windows, OSX and Linux. A large
number of the Node.js community write Node.js on OSX and then deploy to Linux
servers. Because OSX and Linux are based on UNIX this tends to just work.
Windows support is a first-class citizen in Node.js and if you learn to use
Node.js in the right way you can make sure that you can welcome your Windows
friends to your code party.

## Paths

The biggest issue you will run into is paths. Node.js does a great job of taking
care of most of this for you but if you build paths in the wrong way you'll run
into problems on Windows.

Consider you are doing some string concatention to build a path for example.

```javascript
var foo = "foo";
var bar = "bar";
var filePath = foo + "/" + bar + "/";
```

Whilst forward slashes will work ok on Windows if you do string concatenation
you miss out on the protection that the path module in Node.js gives you.

The [path][1] module gives you all of the tools you need to handle
cross-platform paths. For this example we need `path.join`.

```javascript
var filePath = path.join(foo, bar);
// 'foo/bar' on OSX and Linux
// 'foo\\bar' on Windows
```

## Use `path.resolve` to traverse the filesystem

Using `path.resolve` lets you move around the file system but maintain cross
platform compatibility. As per the documentation you can think of it as a series
of `cd` commands that output a single path at the end.

```javascript
path.resolve("../", "/../", "../");
// '/home' on Linux
// '/Users' on OSX
// 'C:\\Users' on Windows
```

## Use `path.normalize` to create reliable paths

If you find yourself doing things like this

```javascript
var filePath = "/home/george/../folder/code";
```

You should be using `path.normalize`. This will present you with the correct
path on whatever platform you are using.

```javascript
var filePath = path.normalize("/home/george/../folder/code");
// '/home/folder/code'
```

## Use `path.join` to join folder names

As we saw before with the string concatenation example kittens can die if you
use string concatenation.

If you need to join paths together use `path.join`. This will also normalize the
result for you.

```javascript
path.join("foo", "..", "bar", "baz/foo");
// 'bar/baz/foo' on OSX and Linux
// 'bar\\baz\\foo' on Windows
```

## Scripts in package.json

Let's say you have the following executable script `npm-postinstall` in the bin
folder of your project.

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
console.log("node modules installed!");
```

If you define scripts to be run in your package.json you will find that Windows
will choke if you rely on a Node.js shebang.

```json
{
  "name": "some-app",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "authors": ["George Ornbo <george@shapeshed.com>"],
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "./bin/npm-postinstall"
  }
}
```

The solution is to use the node executable.

```json
{
  "name": "some-app",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "authors": ["George Ornbo <george@shapeshed.com>"],
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "node bin/npm-postinstall"
  }
}
```

This works for all platforms rather than just OSX and Linux.

## Join shell commands with a double ampersand instead of a semi-colon

If you are working with any form of executing command-line programs, and you
like to execute more than one in a single go, you would probably do so like this
(let's use the basic act of creating a folder and cd'ing into it for brevity):

```javascript
shell.exec("mkdir folder_name; cd folder_name");
```

Unfortunately, that does not work on Windows. Instead, use this:

```javascript
shell.exec("mkdir folder_name && cd folder_name");
```

## Cross Platform Newline Characters

We all know how troublesome newline characters are accross platforms. Some
platforms use '\n', others use '\r', and the rest use both. If you are
struggling to get the newline character to work in your log statements or
strings on multiple platforms, then you might consider a solution that uses
nasty regular expressions to match the correct newline character that you want.
Usually, that would look like this: `/(?:\r\n|[r\n])/`. Yuck. Here's a better
approach. The `OS` module has an `EOL` constant attached to it that when
referred, will output the correct newline character for the operating system.

```javascript
var os = require("os"),
EOL = os.EOL;
console.log('This text will print' + EOL + 'on three lines' + EOL + 'no matter
the OS');
```

Thanks to [Declan de Wet][6] for the above two tips.

## Temporary files

If you need to write files to a `tmp` folder use `os.tmpdir()` to ensure you
write to the correct tmp file location for you platform. Thanks to
[alessioalex][5] for this tip.

## Home directories

On \*nix your home directory is process.env.HOME but in Windows the home
directory is proces.env.HOMEPATH. You can smooth this out with

```javascript
var homedir =
  process.platform === "win32" ? process.env.HOMEPATH : process.env.HOME;
```

The [module-smith][8] module takes care of this for you so if you are interested
in writing cross-platform modules consider using this.

Thanks to [indexzero][7] for this tip.

## Use the os module for more control

If you need even more control you can get the operating system platform and CPU
architecture you are running on react accordingly with the [os module][3].

```javascript
var os = require("os");
os.platform(); // equivalent to process.platform
// 'linux' on Linux
// 'win32' on Windows (32-bit / 64-bit)
// 'darwin' on OSX
os.arch();
// 'x86' on 32-bit CPU architecture
// 'x64' on 64-bit CPU architecture
```

## Conclusion

One of the major strengths of Node.js is the ability to deploy your code on any
platform and to work with almost any development platform. With a bit of
knowledge you can make cross-platform compatibility happen out of the box and
avoid having to write the 'make x compatible on x' ticket.
