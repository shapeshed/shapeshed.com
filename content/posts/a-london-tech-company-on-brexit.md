## A diverse team

Like many businesses in London pebble {code} (a Digital Innovation consultancy)
is made up of a diverse group of individuals. We have a number of EU Nationals
working at pebble {code}. Many of our team live with EU Nationals and as
Londoners this diversity brings colour to our lives and skill to the office we
work in. London is the most vibrant International City I've lived in. We feel
part of Europe and rub shoulders with nationalities from all over the world. It
feeds our capital, our creativity and our energy.

## London The European Technology Hub

London has been growing steadily as a technology hub for a number of reasons.
The City of London provides the finance needed for startups to get off the
ground and for technology innovation to happen. The UK Government has a good
number of programmes to support this too including [InnovateUK][1] and [Digital
Catapult][2]. As a major European capital London can draw on talent from within
European countries. As European Citizens have the right to work in any other
European Country it is easy to hire talent. These factors combine to make London
the European Technology Hub where funding, culture and skill collide. After
Brexit Berlin looks an even more worthy rival.

## Poorer for less investment

Financial markets hate instability and we are entering a massive phase of
uncertainty. It could be two years before Britain leaves the EU and trade deals
cannot be negotiated until then. Why would financiers invest if they are unsure
of the trading environment they are working in? Across the board the UK will
face challenges on Investment and Tech will likely suffer. Startups may not get
funding, corporates may look to pull back on speculative technology products.

## Poorer for less access to talent

We do not know how working arrangements will work out but given than immigration
was such a large part of the Brexit campaign it is anticipated that working
arrangements will change. There has been talk of an Australian style points
system. This would make it harder and slower to bring talent to the UK. Right
now as an employer we can have a Skype call with someone in Madrid and offer
them a job straightaway. By adding more process it is likely that top class
talent may move to other hubs like Berlin or San Francisco.

## Unclear laws

Right now there are a number of European Laws that cover startups in the UK.
These amongst other things surround data protection and data compliance. Quite
what will happen to these rules is unclear. Massive changes to laws could break
business models or cause costly rewrites of code bases. The move to a digital
single market now looks problematic.

## Conclusion

The atmosphere around the office today has been one of deep sadness. As a
Technology Company in London we feel very much part of the European economy and
have served clients from many of the European nations. Whilst we have valid
commercial concerns about what Brexit means for our business the sadness in the
office is as much cultural. Brilliant technology comes out of London as we are
able to attract great European talent and combine with the energy of a diverse,
cosmopolitan capital.

With the vote to leave the EU we have become poorer on a number of levels.
