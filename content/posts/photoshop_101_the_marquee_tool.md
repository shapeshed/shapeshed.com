## A Tool for Daily Use

The Rectangular Marquee is one that you will use on a daily basis particularly
for slicing up psds.

**Tip:** The shortcut key for the Marquee Tool is 'M'. If you have the Photoshop
window highlighted press M on the keyboard and this will select the Rectangular
Marquee Tool.

## Cutting out images and shapes

With the Rectangular Marquee Selected click, hold and drag the mouse over the
part of the image that you want to turn into an image for use on the web. Then
copy the selection using Apple + C (CTRL + C on Windows). If you are using a
layered .psd then it is important that you remember to copy all layers rather
than just the selected one. To do this hit Apple + Shift + C (CTRL + Shift + C
on Windows). Then hit Apple + N (CTRL + N on Windows) to bring up a new
document.

You will note it automatically selects the size of the image you have copied.
Paste the image you have copied into the new window using Apple + V (CTRL + V on
Windows). Finally save this image for the web. To bring up the Save for Web
screen hit Apple + Alt + Shift + S (CTRL + Alt + Shift + S on Windows).

![Selecting and saving an image][1]

This is a task that I perform on a daily basis so learning the keyboard
shortcuts can really save you time.

Returning to your original image you will note that your selection is still
selected. To remove the selection hit the deselect shortcut: Apple + D (CTRL + D
on Windows).

## Getting a precise selection

**Tip:** I recommend using the Info box when you are making selections. To get
this up hit F8. As you drag you will be able to see the size of your selection.

The Marquee tool has a number of options to help you get the precise selection.
If you need a freehand selection though I recommend using the Lasso Tool.
Playing with these tools is much better than describing them so I suggest you
open Photoshop and see them in action.

## Tools

- Rectangular marquee - this is the one I use most often. It is simply a
  rectangular selection box. Holding down Apple + Shift (CTRL + Shift on
  Windows) after you have clicked when you use it will keep the selection
  square.
- Eliptical marquee - this is a circular selection. Again Apple + Shift (CTRL +
  Shift on Windows) keeps the selection circular
- Single row / column marquees - I have never found much use for these but if
  you do want to use them you have to combine them with Add to Selection or
  Remove from Selection (see below).

## Options

In the menu bar at the top you will see a series of options:

![Marquee Toolbar][2]

- New selection - this means that each time you click and drag a new selection
  will be made
- Add to selection - this means that each time you click and drag your selection
  will be add to the existing on one the screen
- Subtract from selection - this means that each time you click and drag your
  selection will be removed from the existing one on the screen
- Intersect with selection - this means that each time you click and drag only
  areas that overlap with the existing selection will be selected.
- Feather - this means the edge of the image will be feathered - you can see the
  effect before and after below. You can specify the width of the feather using
  the box to the right. To feather an image select it then hit Apple + Alt + D
  (CTRL + Alt + D on Windows) ![An example of a feathred image][3]
- Anti-aliasing - you can turn this on to smooth edges
- Style: normal - this allows you to drag the Shape in any direction or size.
- Style: Fixed aspect ratio - this allows you to specify a ratio for the shape.
  For example 30 x 30 will mean the x and y parameters are the same.
- Style: Fixed size - this gives you a fixed select box and can be useful if you
  know the size you want.

## Using the Marquee Tool with Free Transform

A powerful use of the Marquee Tool is to combine it with the Free Transform.
Lets say for example you have pasted your selection into a new image and you
want to fill out the rest of it. You can use the Marquee tool to select an area
of the image that you want to expand. Once you have selected it hit Apple + T
(CTRL + T on Windows) and you will see it changes to a box. Drag the box so it
appears as you want it to. Then hit return to confirm your selection. If you
don't like your selection hit escape.
