## What is the watch command in UNIX?

The `watch` command runs a given command repeatedly and displays the output,
refreshing the screen with each interval. This allows a command to be watched
and produces functionality similar to the `top` command. The command will run
until terminated, usually with CTRL-C. The watch command is very useful for
generating a real-time view of events that are happening on an operating system.

## Watching a file download

In this example an large file is being downloaded via a browser. Using watch the
download folder can be monitored to see if the download has completed.

```sh
watch -n 0.5 ls -a /isos
```

The `-n` option sets the interval at which the screen refreshes in seconds. In
this case it is set to half a second.

Of course for downloading isos you would be much better off using a torrent if
you can!

## Watching a network interface come up

In this example a wireless network connection is enabled and a connection is
established. Using `watch` a real-time of the connection being established and
an ip address being assigned can be seen. The following command will refresh
every 0.5 seconds.

```sh
watch -n 0.5 ip a
```

The command will refresh as the and update connection is established and
eventually it shows the connection is up and the ip address is assigned.

```sh
2: wlp3s0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state DOWN group default qlen 1000
  link/ether fe80::fe80:fe80:fe80:fe80 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

2: wlp3s0: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state DORMANT group default qlen 1000
  link/ether fe80::fe80:fe80:fe80:fe80 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
  inet6 fe80::fe80:fe80:fe80:fe80/64 scope link tentative
  valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

2: wlp3s0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
  link/ether fe80::fe80:fe80 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
  inet6 fe80::fe80:fe80:fe80:fe80/64 scope link tentative
  valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

2: wlp3s0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
  link/ether fe80::fe80:fe80:fe80:fe80 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
  inet 192.168.43.53/24 brd 192.168.43.255 scope global wlp3s0
  valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
  inet6 fe80::fe80:fe80:fe80:fe80/64 scope link
  valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

In this example using `watch` is a much more efficient way of seeing whether a
connection is up than repeatedly running `ip a` or pinging some external site.

## Showing the most CPU intensive processes

The [`ps`][4] can show detailed information on running processes. When combined
with the [`sort`][5] and [`head`][6] commands it can provide a snapshot of
processes at a single point in time.

The following provides a snapshot of the most intensive CPU processes.

```sh
ps aux | sort -nrk 3,3 | head -n 5
```

This is a good example of a where the `watch` command makes something much more
useful. By using the `watch` command the command can be turned in a real-time
`top` like view of CPU intensive. If you are running Google Chrome you will
probably see all five processes coming from Chrome!

```sh
watch "ps aux | sort -nrk 3,3 | head -n 5"
```
