## Outside in Request Headers

If you are writing web applications in an increasingly distributed world the
chances are you will be using other web services outside your application. Often
these services expect headers to be set for things like [User-Agent][1] and
[Authorization][2]. Most frameworks allow you to dump the headers for the
request you are making but to be really sure of the headers you are sending you
may want to examine them from the outside in.

You can do this with [netcat][3]. Netcat is touted as the TCP/IP Swiss Army
knife and with Network Programming becoming more important is an excellent tool.

```sh
netcat -lp 10839
```

This instructs netcat to listen on port 10839. Now you can make a request to it
and see what your application or user agent is sending.

Here's an example with the [w3m][4] browser

```sh
w3m http://localhost:10839
```

The request headers are logged to the console.

```sh
GET / HTTP/1.0
User-Agent: w3m/0.5.3
Accept: text/html, text/*;q=0.5, image/*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, compress, bzip, bzip2, deflate
Accept-Language: en;q=1.0
Host: localhost:9999
```

Here's another example with the [Chromium][5] browser in incognito mode.

```sh
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:10839
Connection: keep-alive
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/32.0.1700.107 Safari/537.36
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8
```

More likely you will want to direct a request from within your application to
netcat to verify your headers. Netcat is a super simple way to quickly debug and
examine headers from outside your application.
