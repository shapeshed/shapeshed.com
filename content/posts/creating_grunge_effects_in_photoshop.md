## Designing with grids

Grids are everywhere in design. Have a look at newspapers for example. The
content is ordered in columns and rows so that the eye can easily scan the
content. Mark Boulton has written a great [series of articles on designing with
grids][1]. In it he shows how to use grids to organise information. Speak to any
designer and they will tell you that Apple + R is a common shortcut in
Photoshop. It brings up rulers which allows you to create your grid in your
Photoshop document. You then use rulers as the backbone of the design. Indeed
<https://www.markboulton.co.uk> is a great example of a clean design using a
strong grid.

## Some clients don't like straight lines

A strength and a weakness of using grids and rulers is that everything lines up.
The eye can easily follow the grid and find a way to the content. Most designers
will have come across a client who does not like neatness. Here you can have two
reactions. The first is that grids are good and you should stand your ground.
The second is to use effects to subtly break the hardness of the grid without
losing the structure.

## Time for some grunge

One approach is to grunge elements within your design. This basically means
messing up the carefully styled hairstyle that a grid offers. There are a number
of ways that you can add some edge to your designs and thankfully free resources
are available. I'm going to be using a set of grunge and scratch brushes from
[Photoshop Brushes][3]. I'm also going to be using a free grunge font NeoPrint.
You can get a copy [from here][4].

## Using grunge and scratch brushes

Custom brushes are a great way to break up a hard geometric shape. In this
example I'm using a couple of brushes to break up a rounded rectangle. Once you
have downloaded the brush set drop it into your brushes folder in Photoshop. You
will find this in Presets / Brushes within the Photoshop file structure. To use
the brush select the brushes tool and then click the brushes dropdown menu. You
will see a flyout menu (see image below) where you can load brushes. Select the
brush set you downloaded and you are good to go. Experiment with different
brushes to get the desired effect.

Then use the brushes to start breaking up the shape both inside and outside of
the curve. You will see that I have rotated the curved rectangle to move it off
centre - again this is an attempt to break the rigidity of a grid.

## Adding a font

As mentioned I'm using NeoPrint a great free font. It has a distressed feel to
it that works with the scratches and grunge of the shape. With a bit of simple
work the effect is done.

Breaking, or bending grids is simple. Don't get rid of grids but don't be
constrained by them.
