## What is the mkdir command in UNIX?

The `mkdir` command in UNIX allows users to create directories or folders as
they are referred to in some operating systems. The `mkdir` command can create
multiple directories at once and also set permissions when creating the
directory. The user running the command must have appropriate permissions on the
parent directory to create a directory or will receive a permission denied
error.

## How to create a directory

To create a directory in UNIX or Linux using the `mkdir` command pass the name
of directory to the `mkdir` command.

```sh
mkdir mydirectory
ls
mydirectory
```

## How to create multiple directories

To create multiple directories in UNIX or Linux using the `mkdir` command pass
the names of directories to be created to the `mkdir` command. The names of
directories should be separated by spaces.

```sh
mkdir foo bar baz
ls
foo bar baz
```

## How to create parent directories

To create parent directories using the `mkdir` command pass the `-p` option.
Suppose that the directory path `foo/bar/baz` is to be created. This can be
created with `mkdir` as follows.

```sh
mkdir foo
cd foo
mkdir bar
cd bar
mkdir baz
tree foo
foo
└── bar
    └── baz
```

This may also be achieved in a single command with the `-p` flag.

```sh
mkdir -p foo/bar/baz
tree foo
foo
└── bar
    └── baz
```

## Insufficient permissions when creating a directory

The `mkdir` command will return a permission denied error when trying to create
a directory in a parent directory that the user does not have permissions for.

```sh
mkdir /etc/foo
mkdir: cannot create directory ‘/etc/foo’: Permission denied
```

In this instance to create a directory in this location the user will need
`sudo` permissions or to contact a system administrator.

## How to set permissions when creating a directory

To set permissions when creating a directory pass the `-m` option. This accepts
a number value to set the file mode. If no options are passed to `mdkir` the
directory will be created with read, write and execute permissions for the user
(755). In the following example the directory is created to be world readable.

```sh
mkdir -m 777 foo
ls -la
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 3 george users 4096 Sep  9 20:59 .
drwxr-xr-x 8 george users 4096 Sep  9 20:47 ..
drwxrwxrwx 2 george users 4096 Sep  9 20:59 foo
```
