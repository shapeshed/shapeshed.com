## BBC Radio feeds

To the annoyance of some the BBC [removed support for Windows Media][2] and have
migrated to using the AAC codec and http streaming. The good news is that the
AAC streams are high quality and freely available. [Matthew Peet][1] shared the
links to the 320 kbps HLS AAC streams on his site.

## Listening with mpv

[mpv][1] is a fantastic cross-platform media player that can handle most formats
thrown at it. It is based on [mplayer][4] and [mplayer2][5]. Playing a BBC
stream is just a case of passing the URL to it. Magic.

```sh
mpv 'http://a.files.bbci.co.uk/media/live/manifesto/audio/simulcast/hls/uk/sbr_high/ak/bbc_6music.m3u8'
```

## Some useful aliases

I made some [aliases][7] for the stations so I can stream with simple command.
Running `playbbcr6` for example plays BBC 6 Music.

```sh
alias playbbcr1="mpv 'http://a.files.bbci.co.uk/media/live/manifesto/audio/simulcast/hls/uk/sbr_high/ak/bbc_radio_one.m3u8'"
alias playbbcr4="mpv 'http://a.files.bbci.co.uk/media/live/manifesto/audio/simulcast/hls/uk/sbr_high/ak/bbc_radio_fourfm.m3u8'"
alias playbbcr5l="mpv 'http://a.files.bbci.co.uk/media/live/manifesto/audio/simulcast/hls/uk/sbr_high/ak/bbc_radio_five_live.m3u8'"
alias playbbcr5lsx="mpv 'http://a.files.bbci.co.uk/media/live/manifesto/audio/simulcast/hls/uk/sbr_high/ak/bbc_radio_five_live_sports_extra.m3u8'"
alias playbbcr6="mpv 'http://a.files.bbci.co.uk/media/live/manifesto/audio/simulcast/hls/uk/sbr_high/ak/bbc_6music.m3u8'"
```

## Listening to iPlayer Radio content

It is also possible to pass any URL from iPlayer (audio and video) to mpv. More
magic

```sh
mpv http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07z4djf
```

## Listening from outside the UK

Whilst I was over in the USA (virtually at least) listening to these streams was
not possible so there looks to be geo-blocking on these streams. A UK VPN would
work I imagine.

```sh
playbbc6
Playing: http://a.files.bbci.co.uk/media/live/manifesto/audio/simulcast/hls/uk/sbr_high/ak/bbc_6music.m3u8
[ffmpeg] http: HTTP error 403 Forbidden
[lavf] avformat_open_input() failed
```
