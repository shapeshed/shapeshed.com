## A hostile environment

The web is an extremely hostile environment. Users on the web can access sites
in a myriad of different ways causing a huge number of variables including:

- The browser they are using and the capabilities of that browser
- Local preferences on the browser
- Broadband connection speed
- Screen Resolution

But the list of variables is not just limited to users. Servers have hugely
different configurations and can also cause headaches.

So how do you deal with all these variables?

## I know best

The "I know best" philosophy suggests that developers know more things than they
don't in the design environment. They design applications with the idea that
they understand the design environment and the variables within it. The
application is tested for the requirements at that time and matches these
requirements so everyone is happy. So what's the problem?

The problem is when the application grows, changes or moves environments. The
fact that the application has not anticipated change is a fundamental flaw in
the application design and one that can be negated by simply coding defensively.

## Coding defensively

Coding defensively can help limit these issues by anticipating issues and
accounting for them. It is proactive coding rather than reactive coding. By
assuming nothing you are actually anticipating problems and dealing with them
before they happen. It is likely that in many cases you won't see the error when
it happens as you have already anticipated it and dealt with it.

## An example

Let's take the example of an Apache .htaccess file. It is common for many web
developers to use the .htaccess file to redirect pages with Rewrite rules.

For example removing www:

```apache
Options +FollowSymLinks
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^yourdomain\.com$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://yourdomain.com/$1 [R=301,L]
```

The issue is if the mod_rewrite module is not available in Apache you'll get a
nice 500 Internal Error message. But you can prevent this with a simple if
statement:

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
# put any rules relating to the mod_rewrite module here
</IfModule>
```

If the module is not available it will be ignored, so no error. It is a simple
if statement that avoids an error.

## A cross-language philosophy

This article is less about examples and more about the idea of using an if
statement to test for things that may or may not be available. Here's an example
in Javascript where we are looking for an element with the id "clickme". Have a
look at this code:

```javascript
var clickme = document.getElementById("clickme");
clickme.onclick = function () {
  // run some code
};
```

There's two points at which this script could fail. Firstly if the browser
doesn't support getElementByID and secondly if an element with the id of clickme
does not exist. We can fix that with a couple of defensive if statements:

```javascript
if (!document.getElementById) {
  return;
}
var clickme = document.getElementById("clickme");
if (!clickme) {
  return;
}
clickme.onclick = function () {
  // run some code
};
```

Via a couple of defensive if statements we have bulletproofed the script. It
anticipates things that might not be available and provides an exit strategy if
they are not. If the browser does not support getElementById the script will
exit and if an element with the id of clickme is not present it will also exit.
So you won't a javascript error. This is also good for future-proofing the code.
The markup on the page may well change and if the element with the id of clickme
is removed the script will not error.

## A simple philosophy

The defensive if statement is a simple philosphy that assumes nothing but
accounts for everything. Whilst you would be a robot if you anticipated
everything you will make your application more maintainable and bulletproof by
thinking about this whilst you are designing and creating your application. The
benefits are numerous and it is such a simple idea to adapt you would be a fool
not to.
