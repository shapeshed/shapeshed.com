## Nginx

My preferred way of installing nginx on OSX is using [homebrew][1]. You need to
compile it with passenger support

```sh
brew install nginx --with-passenger
```

## RVM

[RVM][3] makes it easy to manage multiple rubies. Installation is easy

```sh
bash < <( curl http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/releases/rvm-install-head )
```

You can then install different versions of ruby. In this case let's install
[Ruby Enterprise Edition][2]

```sh
rvm install ree
```

Then we can make Ruby Enterprise Edition the default Ruby on this machine with

```sh
rvm --default ree
```

## Passenger

This is the most tricky part of the install. To start you'll need the passenger
gem

```sh
gem install passenger
```

We need to use the nginx source code for this process. If your homebrew setup is
a default one run

```sh
tar -xzf /Users/george/Library/Caches/Homebrew/nginx-0.8.53.tar.gz
```

Note your version of nginx may be different from this!

Then we need to run the nginx passenger module installer

```sh
passenger-install-nginx-module
```

The default install downloads an entirely new binary for Nginx - a bit annoying.
If you choose option 2 you'll be able to choose the source you've downloaded
with homebrew. For the source directory choose the one we've just extracted

```sh
/Users/george/Library/Caches/Homebrew/nginx-0.8.53
```

Then choose to install Nginx to (if you've used the default homebrew install)

```sh
/usr/local/Cellar/nginx/0.8.53/sbin
```

Hit return on the next two prompts. Drink tea whilst it compiles.

The installer spits out some configuration for you. Open up
`/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` in your favourite text editor and paste this
in.

Then you just need to create a virtual host

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name foo.local;
    root /webapps/foo.com/public;
    passenger_enabled on;
}
```

Provided you've added foo.local to your /etc/hosts file you should be able to
start the server and see your site using

```sh
sudo nginx
```

## Running multiple virtual hosts

Passenger 3 adds a killer feature - the ability to run a standalone passenger
and proxy using Nginx and TCP sockets. The process for this is to first setup a
virtual host to proxy through to a socket

```nginx
upstream bar_upstream {
    server unix:/tmp/bar.local.socket;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name bar.local;
    root /webapps/bar.local/public;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://bar_upstream;
    }
}
```

Then start a standalone instance of Passenger. This downloads and complies a new
binary of Nginx for some reason

```sh
passenger start --socket /tmp/bar.local.socket -d --nginx-version 0.8.53
```

This is explained in more detail on the [Phusion Blog][5]. Because the
standalone passenger is invoked within an RVM context it is completely possible
to have different ruby versions and gemsets. TOTAL WIN!

It should then be trivial use something like [Monit][4] to make sure that the
process for virtual hosts is running and start / stop it.

This setup can be applied to a Linux server too to create a flexible Rails stack
with multiple hosts, Rubies and gemsets.
