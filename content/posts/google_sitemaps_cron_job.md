There are plenty of good articles out there about how to use the script provided
by Google but I struggled to find information on how to set up the cron job for
the task.

So in case anyone else needs it here's a cron job that works for me on Unix. You
need to make sure you specify absolute paths. If you don't have root access then
talk to your host but they should tell you where python resides. If you want to
find out your document root you can find this in PHP by using the [phpinfo()][1]
function.

This runs the scheduled task of generating a sitemap each day at 6am.

```sh
0 6 * * * /enter/your/path/to/python /enter/your/path/to/sitemap/_gen.py --config=/enter/your/path/to/example/_config.xml
```
