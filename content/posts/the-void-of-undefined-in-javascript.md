## Undefined

Undefined is a JavaScript primitive that is used when a value has not been
assigned a value. If you have done more than one day's programming in any
language you will realise that this is an important building block for
programmers.

You can check if a value is undefined in JavaScript like this

```js
if (typeof x === "undefined") {
  console.log("it is undefined");
}
```

You might choose to set a defined value to undefined.

```js
var foo = "bar";
console.log(foo); // "bar"
foo = undefined;
console.log(foo); // undefined
```

What you may know is that until ES5 undefined was mutable so if there are other
scripts on your page there is chance it could cause unwanted results.

```js
// a naughty global variable from another script
var undefined = "oops";

var foo = "bar";
console.log(foo); // "bar"
foo = undefined;
console.log(foo); // "oops"
```

ES5 improved this by making undefined immutable. If your JavaScript engine
[supports ES5][4] (and that feature) you are good. Or you might think you are.
Because undefined isn't a reserved word it may be used as a function argument
name. This also leads to unwanted results.

```js
var foo = function (undefined) {
  "use strict";

  var x = "foo";
  console.log(x); // "foo"
  var x = undefined;
  console.log(x); // "oops"
};

foo("oops");
```

Let's say someone is using your library within that function and you reference
undefined. You get the string "oops". Oops indeed.

Update: Axel Rauschmayer contacted me via Twitter over this section.

Hopefully my response clears this up. It is not an issue within a function but
it would be if undefined has been decalred globally. Run the jsfiddle examples
to illustrate this.

## Void

Void in JavaScript is one of Crockford's bad parts of Javascript

> and it is very confusing. Avoid void.

-- <cite>[Douglas Crockford][1]</cite>

ES5 [defines void][2] as a unary operator returning undefined for whatever it is
given. Noteably `void` is also a reserved work in JavaScript meaning you cannot
reassign void. In the console we can see what void does

```js
void 0;
undefined;
```

Several libraries and frameworks use void in place of undefined presumably
because it is absolutely immutable and can be relied on to return undefined in
whatever context it is used.

Underscore.js uses it to check if a value is undefined

```js
_.isUndefined = function (obj) {
  return obj === void 0;
};
```

The Closure compiler also favours `void 0`

```js
var foo = undefined;
```

Compiles to

```js
var foo = void 0;
```

## Swerve the bear trap

Undefined is another potential bear trap in JavaScript that can lose hours in
debugging that can be avoid if you understand how it works. Because JavaScript
can always be run in the context of other scripts you might well reference
undefined and then find that somewhere else it has been redefined, either by
being reassigned in ES3 or being used as a function argument in ES5.

Of course this is terrible programming but if you throw your scripts out there
on the web you've got to expect that somewhere, at some time someone is going to
do it. You can use linters to some extent to avoid this. JSHint for example
allows you to enforce ES5 mode which will complain if you try and reassign
undefined, but using undefined as a function argument is legal.

Whether you chose to use `void 0` or not is up to you, but you should at least
be aware that undefined isn't absolutely immutable.
