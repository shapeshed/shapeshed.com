Compiling Node.js from source is easy enough so here's how.

## Installing from a tarball

Node.js needs a few things to compile so make sure they are installed.

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential openssl libssl-dev pkg-config
```

Get the link for the latest tarball from the Source Code link on the [Node.js
homepage][3]. Then download it and extract it.

```sh
cd /usr/local/src
sudo mkdir node
cd node
sudo wget http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.6.6/node-v0.6.6.tar.gz
sudo tar -xzf node-v0.6.6.tar.gz
```

Now you can compile and install the binary. By default Node.js will be installed
to `/usr/local/bin/node` and npm will be installed to `/usr/local/bin/npm`.

```sh
cd node-v0.6.6/
sudo ./configure
sudo make
sudo make install
```

## Upgrading via a tarball

To upgrade Node.js simply download the new tarball, extract and repeat the
installation process.

## Installing from Git

If you plan to upgrade each time a new release comes out you may find cloning
the Git repository more convenient than downloading and extracting a tarball
each time.

You will need Git and the dependencies to be installed first.

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git-core build-essential openssl libssl-dev pkg-config
```

Using Git means that instead of downloading extracting a tarball you can just
clone the repository and checkout the latest version. If you need to check the
versions that are available run `git tag`.

```sh
cd /usr/local/src
sudo git clone git://github.com/joyent/node.git
cd node
sudo git checkout v0.6.6
```

Now you can compile the binary as before

```sh
sudo ./configure
sudo make
sudo make install
```

## Upgrading via Git

To upgrade to a new release of Node.js first pull the latest source.

```sh
cd /usr/local/src/node
sudo git checkout master
sudo git pull origin master
```

Then checkout the latest version where `v.x.x.x` is the version you want.

```sh
sudo git checkout vx.x.x
```

Then follow the installation process as before

```sh
sudo ./configure
sudo make
sudo make install
```

This will upgrade Node.js and overwrite the previous version.
