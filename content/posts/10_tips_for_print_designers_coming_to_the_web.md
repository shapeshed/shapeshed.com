## Meet pixels

![Pixels][1]

The primary unit of designing for the web is Pixels. Particularly when you are
setting up your page you will need to be aware of pixels. When creating a new
document Photoshop allows you to select a number of predefined page sizes for
the web. It is a good idea to have rulers switched on so you can see pixel
widths. To view rulers go to View > Rulers. It is possible that the default unit
is not pixels. Right click on one of the rulers to bring up a menu and select
pixels.

## Screen size is not uniform

Screen sizes or viewports are not uniform on the web. Most users will have
screens of at least 1024 x 768 pixels, although to be absolutely safe you should
design for 800 x 600. Often screens are slightly smaller so it is a good idea to
bring designs in 10 pixels from the default.

## Fixed width and Fluid width

You may decide that you want your design to stretch with the size of the
viewport. The advantages of this are that the entire width of the screen will be
filled. The disadvantage is that your design will be pulled sideways on very
wide screens. This is very much a matter of personal preference. Compare a fixed
width design like the [BBC][2] to a fluid design like [Slashdot][3]. It is a
compromise between filling the screen and maintaining control over your design.

If you are feeling really adventurous there is also elastic layout - see [Jon
Oxton's article][4] or [this article on][5] A List Apart.

## Limited fonts

In order for a font to display as text on the web it has to be on the users
computer. There are ways to get round this but it is good practice to understand
that there are limitations to the fonts you can use as text. Of course if you
wish you can create text as images and use any font you like but this has some
accessibility and search engine optimisation implications. Familirise yourself
with the fonts that are available by default. There are two good surveys on
installed fonts for [Windows][6] and for [Mac][7]. If a user does not have a
font you can specify another one that should be used. A CSS coder can explain
this to you in further detail.

## Deliver designs as layered Photoshop files

The Industry standard for delivering designs is a layered .psd Photoshop file.
Keep everything seperate - that means background images, colours, and text. This
will make coding the site quicker and easier. Leave text as text - do not
convert to symbols as you would for print as this will hide the font type and
size from the coder.

## Don't expect your design to look the same on all browsers

Possibly the most difficult thing to accept for print designers is that they
have less control over designs on the web. Users are able to alter designs by
enlarging text, turning off styling or images. Furthermore browsers interpret
code differently so your design may appear slightly differently on Opera than it
does on Internet Explorer. A good XTHML and CSS coder will be able to make it as
close to the design as possible but beware that there may be some minor
differences.

## Be aware of Web Safe colours

![Web safe colours][8]

Computer screens are improving but there are still a significant number that are
unable to display all colours. If you want to be certain that your design will
display consistently across the web you need to use web safe colours. In
Photoshop's colour picker you can check 'Web Safe Colors'. This will reduce the
palette to colours that will display on the web. Yes it is limited! If you do
not use web safe colours beware that the colour of your design may display
inconsistently on some monitors.

## Scrolling issues

Vertical scrolling is normal but beware that particularly on the homepage your
should have your most important page elements within the Viewport. The point at
which the screen scrolls is called the fold. On 800 x 600 screens this is at
600px. At very least you should have your navigation and logo before the fold.

Horizontal scrolling is generally frowned on. Users are not used to this
convention and it is not recommended so avoid this.

## Take advantage the web for inspiration

One of the great things about the web is that you can access any design. There
are a number of style galleries you can browse and bookmark. If you are familiar
with RSS you can subscribe to feeds from the major ones and have new designs
delivered to your newsreader each day. A number of good ones are [Stylegala][9],
[Netdiver][10], [CSS Drive][11] and [CSS Elite][12].

## Learn XHMTL and CSS

Although you do not need to know XHTML and CSS to design for the web you will be
giving yourself a strong advantage if you understand the medium your a designing
for. There are some excellent books now on the market to introduce you to XTHML
and CSS. Many designers have learnt XHTML and CSS - it is not difficult and your
designs will be more robust and better informed as a result. A couple of
recommended books are: [Beginning CSS Web Development][13] and [Build Your Own
Website the Right Way][14].
