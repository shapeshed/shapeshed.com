## Cloning parts of images

The clone tool allows you to select an area of a photo and use it to paint with
as if it were a brush. This allows you to correct blemishes in a photo or to
remove sections of a photo entirely. To do this hold ALT and click to define the
target area. You will the icon change to a target icon.

Tip: For many tasks the [Healing Brush][1] is a better option. Instead of
copying a selection exactly it merges the selection with the pixels already on
the page.

To select the clone tool hit S on the keyboard. In order to use the tool you
must first define a selection. This provides Photoshop with a reference of where
you want to start. You should also choose an appropriate brush. If you want to
clone a large area choose a large brush. If you are doing very precise work you
should choose a small brush.

In the video below we are going to remove one of the birds. The photo is by
[eMotionBlogster][2]. Watch as the selection point is defined and then the brush
strokes removes the bird whilst keeping the correct sky colours behind it. As
you use the clone tool you may need to resample as you go - you will see this
happening in the video as the cursor turns to a target icon.

You might also wish to try this technique with the [Healing Brush Tool][1]. It
may save you time. Which tool you use for this purpose is personal choice.

## Clone Tool Options

There are a large number of options available to you with the Clone Tool:

- Mode - This is the mode of the brush. There are many options here and you are
  best to play with them to discover them. For the majority of uses of the Clone
  Tool normal is best.
- Opacity - This is how transparent the pixels that you paint on the canvas are.
  If you set this to 0 you won't be able to see your work at all. If it is at
  100 then you won't see anything underneath the area you paint.
- Flow - This is similar to opacity but if you paint over the same area twice
  without releasing the mouse it has the effect of painting on top again. So if
  you set the Flow to 50 the first time you paint you will see the image
  underneath at 50%, but if you pass over it again it will be removed.
- Airbrush - This enables airbrush capabilities
- Aligned - This means you can release the mouse button without losing the
  current sampling point.
- Sample All Layers - If you have a document with more than one layer this means
  the sample point will include all layers.

## Pattern Stamp Tool

The pattern stamp tool lets you paint with a pattern. To define a pattern use
the [Marquee Tool][3] to define the area that you want to use. Then select the
Pattern Stamp Tool. Then go to Edit > Define Pattern. You will be asked to give
your Pattern a name. In the toolbar at the top you will see an additional option
box with Pattern in. As before you have the same options. This tool is useful in
applying textured overlays to images. Try lowering the opacity and painting over
an image to give it a grainy effect.
