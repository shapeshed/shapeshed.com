## The goal

On a regular basis at [pebble.code][21] where I work we have a requirement to
provision servers for clients, mostly for Rails apps. In the past we have used a
combination of Cloud PaaS providers like [Heroku][22] or [Engine Yard][23], we
have built servers manually (gasp) or used bash scripts.

[Puppet][20] is a tool for building and managing servers and looked like a great
fit for our requirements.

## Learning curve

Puppet has a learning curve but there are lots of excellent resources available
on the web. I found [Pulling Strings With Puppet][1] to be an excellent resource
and there is also some [good documentation][2] on the Puppet site. I've written
before on how to [set up Puppet on Ubuntu 10.04][3] and also how to [connect
clients to a Puppet master][4].

Once you learn about [resources][13] and [modules][14] you are pretty much ready
to get going.

## Setting up Puppet Dashboard

Puppet comes with a dashboard that can be run on the Puppet Master to give a
graphic view into what your nodes are doing, providing reports of updates and
letting you know if there are any problems. There's some good documentation
[offered by PuppetLabs][18] on this to get you started.

I had some problems getting this going getting the error

```sh
can't activate rack (~> 1.0.1), already activated rack-1.2.2
```

[This thread][15] on the puppet-users mailing list gives a fix

```sh
cd <path-to-dashboard>
git clone git://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-dashboard.git
rm -r vendor/gems/rack-1.0.1
sed -i -e 's,~> 1.0.1,~> 1.2.2,' vendor/rails/actionpack/lib/action_controller.rb
```

After that I was able to see the nodes and updates.

## Rails stack choices

Then came the hard part - creating Puppet modules and using third party ones to
install software on the server. I ended up writing my own for some but used
existing modules where possible.

The ones I found most useful in building a Rails stack were

- [puppet-rvm][7]
- [puppet-nginx][8]
- [puppetlabs-mysql][9]
- [puppet-monit][10]

One issue is where to put the responsibility for some items in the stack. The
web server is a good example. In my case I chose to use Unicorn and manage the
installation of this via [bundler][11] and the Gemfile of the application. I
could have chosen to use Puppet for this with something like Passenger. For
automation Passenger is difficult to upgrade as it needs to be recompiled
against Apache or Nginx. By chosing Unicorn I can upgrade it easily using
bundler. To manage Unicorn I use an [init][12] script and hook this up to Monit
and capistrano recipes. I'm still not sure about this approach but it works at
least.

## Switching the Puppet Master to Unicorn

As the number of nodes grew, and particularly where a new node was added I found
that the default WEBrick server that ships with Puppet was not good enough and I
started to hit some errors. Thankfully there is an [excellent wiki article][5]
on the Puppet Labs site walking through how to switch Puppet to using
[Unicorn][6]. Unicorn is a great web server and handles load balancing itself -
perfect for my requirements.

## Workflow

I chose to deploy using Capistrano and a git based workflow. I have an init
script for the Unicorn Master powering Puppet so I can take advantage of the
rolling restarts offered by Unicorn.

## Still to do

I still need to create a good framework for testing. Currently I run things
against a blank VM. There are a [few][17] [patterns][16] for testing which I
would like to become a bit more familiar with and use. I'd like to extend a few
existing modules and write a few new ones, particularly for user management.

## The good bit

The good bit is that we can now create a secure, bootstrapped server that can
host any rack application with any cloud provider within about 20 minutes.
Moreover we can manage SSH keys with Puppet so it is easy to grant and revoke
developer access.

There's more to learn but in my opinion the investment of time was well worth
it.

After reading this article [Matt Tanase][25] contacted me about a great project
called [Blueprint][24]. If you are porting existing infrastructure to Puppet
have a look.
