## Much to admire

The Central Office of Information is the UK Goverment's centre of excellent for
marketing and communications. It is very encouraging that the department is
producing a browser standards document and there is much to admire in the [COI's
Browser Standards Draft][1]. The desire to provide a consistent experience to
users of Government Websites is a commendable aspiration. The document outlines
how Government sites should be required to support multiple platforms and gives
a good overview of the issues at stake for non-technical readers.

## Much not to admire

The metric chosen to define a browser standard is browser usage on a site by
site basis.

> Your browser standard must be based on the most popular browsers accessing
> your website.

Furthermore it is advised that browser standards are based on target audience
demographics.

> Different target audiences have different browser preferences. For example,
> students are more likely to use Firefox than corporate or business users.
> Therefore, browser standards should also take into account target audience
> demographics.

In my opinion this is just plain wrong and the document has failed to understand
the nature of the browser market in general, and the efforts that browser
vendors ([including][2] [Microsoft][3]) have been making to converge browser
capabilities using Web Standards rather than diverge capabilities using
proprietary technologies.

During the [browser wars][4] of the late 1990s Netscape Navigator and Internet
Explorer went head to head with a series of different technologies that meant
that many sites advised visitors to use one browser or the other to ensure that
the site functioned correctly. This is the kind of philosophy that would support
a browser standard based on usage on an individual site. Thankfully this
situation no longer exists.

## We have standards

The W3C and the browser community in general have worked very hard to bring the
browser market together so that site producers can broadly use a defined set of
standards and enjoy consistent display in any browser. There are quirks in
browsers but the key message is that we have gone beyond the issues of the late
1990s to arrive a situation where standards based websites do not need to worry
about whether or not a users experience is consistent.

Here's where I feel the draft document is wrong:

> However, there are a large number of different browsers on the market and to
> support all of them would be impractical and inefficient.

This statement is taken to mean that as there are so many divergent browsers we
should create a standard based on the browsers that are used on a single site.
But the internet is not just single sites. It is a large cohesive network of
sites that live and breathe together. We have a set of standards that make
creating websites practical and efficient and we have a set of browsers that
largely support and interpret these standards correctly. So my point is that we
should focus on producing Browser Standards based on convergence and not
divergence to reflect the status of the browser market.

## We have a standard of sorts

The work that this document is attempting to do has already been done by one of
the largest players on the Internet - Yahoo!. [Yahoo's Graded Browser
Support][5] has become a defacto standard on the web. It bases browser support
on capability and not on usage. I won't duplicate the explination here - there
are details on the [Yahoo's Graded Browser Support][6] page.

In the GBS We have an excellent framework we can use that covers the
overwhelming majority of the browser market based on browser capability.

## Conclusion

My opinion is that the COI has got this draft very wrong and that it needs to be
rewritten to base browser support on capability and not usage. Failing to do so
would be a serious misunderstanding of the efforts that the browser market has
been making to make it easier for site producers to produce consistent,
multi-platform websites.

I seriously hope the COI will reconsider this position. There are [many][7]
[others][8] [who][9] agree with me. You can add your weight to the argument by
[reading][10] and [responding to the consultation][11] before October 17th.
