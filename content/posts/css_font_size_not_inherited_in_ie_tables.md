```css
body {
  font: 72%/160%, "Lucida Grande", "Lucida Sans", "Trebuchet MS", Tahoma, Verdana,
    sans-serif;
}
```

So off I went to find out what others had been doing. It took me a while to find
the answer so incase it helps someone else find it I'm posting it up here.

One hack suggested using the !important declaration to redeclare the font size
for IE6 and below. That would clog up my style sheet a bit so I wasn't impressed
with that one.

Happily I found a much better hack. It works with just one line of code and the
font size in my tables is now appearing correctly. To correct font-size in
tables simple add this line to the css that controls your table:

```css
font-size: 1em;
```

So my CSS for my table looks like this and it is now behaving properly.

```css
table {
  border-spacing: 0;
  border-collapse: collapse;
  /* fix for IE6 and below not inheriting font size */
  font-size: 1em;
}
```
