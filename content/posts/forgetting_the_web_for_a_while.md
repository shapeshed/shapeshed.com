I discovered a great tow-path that goes from Putney Bridge all the way to Richmond. The tow-path is good enough for road bikes to go down and some of the views were just great.\n\n"

On the second ride I ventured a bit further and found a nature reserve next to
Ham House and it was amazing. I was about 30 minutes from Central London but I
felt a million miles from the city.

![I love summer][1]

Summers in England are always amazing. I think this one is even better as we've
had some great weather on the back of a miserable winter.

With weather this good who cares about AJAX, DOM and CSS?
