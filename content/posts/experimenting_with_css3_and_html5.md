[![Experimental Site on Github Pages][1]][2]

## No Database

With Github pages you are not able to use a database. This was actually an
attraction for me. Increasingly the data that I want to show is distributed
around various part of the internet. [Christian Heilmann][2] has demonstrated
how it is possible to create a site almost entirely from APIs. Through
expriements with YQL and native APIs it became clear that most of the data that
I wanted to show is available through APIs.

The site makes JSONP calls to Twitter, LastFM, Flickr and Lighthouse. There's no
caching as yet or error handling but hopefully this can be addressed in the
future.

## HTML5

I wanted to experiment with [HTML5][3] and realistically I couldn't do this on a
client site. Writing HTML5 just felt right - there are now tags for the header,
navigation and footer - elements I've used on every site I've ever created. I
didn't really use any of the new APIs that are offered by HTML5 so perhaps
that's something for the future. I'm now even more encouraged to use HTML5.

## CSS3

I've been using elements of CSS3 for some time but this was a chance to really
let rip. Of course this leaves browsers like [Internet Explorer][4] out in the
cold but that wasn't really the point of this project. In fact I chose not to
support Internet Explorer at all. Why? Because I could I suppose. Supporting IE
is the day job.

## Jekyll

The engine behind the site is [Jekyll][9], a simple static site generator. It
parses Markdown or Textile documents and outputs a static site. I found it easy
to learn and feature rich enough for this project.

## Open source

Pretty much everything I've have learned in terms of my job has been through
people sharing their knowledge. So I love the idea that people can clone the
site repository and play with it, or even enhance it.

You can view [the site here][6] and see what's under the hood at [the Github
repository][7].
