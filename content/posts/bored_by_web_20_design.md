## Web 2.0 design

![This is rid.iculo.us][1]

Welcome to web 2.0. The land of shiny surfaces, reflections and half finished
websites. Much like the code libraries out there designers are grabbing what is
freely available without understanding how it works or what it is used for. Many
Web 2.0 sites are over obsessing on design without focussing on what is really
important - the user experience. Even operating systems are guilty of this.
Windows are marketing the 'Wow' for example on the Vista UI. Yes it does look
glossy and shiny. Wow. But what about the annoyance of having to click ok every
time you want to do anything?

## Successful sites are not jumping on the bandwagon

The emerging winners in the Web 2.0 gold rush have not adopted glossy AJAXified
interfaces. Instead they have opted for good old fashioned intuitive interfaces.
Look at [Basecamp][2] for example. A critical eye might say it is light on
design. But it does what it needs to do and helps the user to complete tasks
easily. They use AJAX sparingly and don't rely heavily on it. [Flickr][3] is
clean and lean and helps the user to perform tasks quickly and simply. Surely
they could lose the Gamma tag by now though!?

Both sites have been successful as they make it easy for users to do what they
want to do quickly.

## Using new technologies prudently

Code libraries have emerged that allow designers to plug functionality into
sites quickly and easily. Sadly though in many cases designers and coders don't
understand the code they are using. More often than not AJAX on sites is not
thoroughly tested across different browsers and operating systems. This is a
huge failure of Web 2.0. My personal experience is that AJAX is very hard to do
well. You must cater for users with Javascript turned off and most importantly
understand the technology you are using. Many projects opt to use AJAX without
realising that it may in fact increase development time. As the deadline looms a
worse product is produced, but with a few more bells and whistles.

## Looking back to the 80's

Web 2.0 reminds me of the synthesizer in the 80's. It is a new toy for designers
to play with. It does so much. The majority don't understand what they are using
and most of what is being produced is utter rubbish. A few visionaries really do
get it though, but they probably won't be acknowledged for another 20 years.

## Time to reboot

For me it is time we looked beyond the glossy surfaces and reflections.
Designers need to focus more on user experience. They need to look outside the
web for inspiration. It seems to me the history of Graphic Design has been
largely dumped for a fading AJAX effect. It is time to look around outside the
web: at posters, at newspapers, at typography, at history. It is also time
designers get to grips with the fact that if a user can't interact with a site
then it has failed in its main purpose and they are not doing their job.

The web is still new and we are all still learning. I'm bored of Web 2.0 design
though.
