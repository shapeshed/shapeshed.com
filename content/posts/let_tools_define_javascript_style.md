## No rules

One of the reasons that people love/hate JavaScript so much is that there are so
many different ways that you can do something. Reading through the source code
of node modules and JavaScript libraries universally there is difference. The
difference comes from the language itself. JavaScript gives you tools to solve
the same problem in many ways.

Working in a small team or on an open source project this can be a problem. You
might recieve a pull request that has the following style

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
    var express = require('express')
      , routes = require('./routes')
      , user = require('./routes/user')
      , http = require('http')
      , path = require('path');
```

The branch you are pulling into has the following style.

```js
var express = require("express"),
  routes = require("./routes"),
  user = require("./routes/user"),
  http = require("http"),
  path = require("path");
```

Both are valid and developers will argue passionately for both. Because
JavaScript is permissive the smallest item like a semicolon can lead to
[impassioned pleas][1] and [detailed posts][2] about how you can and should be
using semicolons. So which style is correct? Whichever one you think is correct.
Put simply it comes down to opinion.

## How you document opinion

How you document your opinion on JavaScript style is up to you. Some create
excellent [style guides][3], others [write books][4]. In the bowels of IRC
channels and Twitter messages are flying back and forth even as we speak about
what you should and shouldn't do in JavaScript. However you choose to do it it
is still just opinion if the syntax is legal.

## The only rule

The only rule for me is to respect the author of the project you are
contributing to. If you are the author you can define the style. If you are not
the author you should respect the style they have chosen. If you submit a pull
request to an open source project it should be in exactly the same style as the
project. Once merged my code should be invisible in terms of style.

Clearly for small teams it makes sense to have this discussion up front, have an
arm wrestle and agree. But unless you enjoy trolling and having pull requests
politely rejected just do the sane thing and respect a diversity of style.

## Opinion from tools

JavaScript tooling is improving all the time and linting tools are now very
capable at encapsulating your opinion. [JSHint][5] and [JSLint][6] are both
excellent tools that not only lint your code for common mistakes but also let
you specify a large amount of style. As this is a common requirement you can
enapsulate this in a `.jshintrc` file and carry it round your projects. A
`.jshintrc` file is a JSON file that contains your preferences about how the
linter should behave. If you want to lint that strict mode should be used all
the time just do this

```json
"strict": true
```

There are [many options][7] you can configure and the chances are you already
have opinions about what they should be. Once you have your opinions documented
you can integrate your opinion into your build process. Grunt is a good choice
for this. First install the command line inteface for grunt.

```sh
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Add dependencies to your `package.json` file.

```json
"devDependencies": {
  "grunt": "0.4.0",
  "grunt-contrib-jshint": "0.2.0",
}
```

Then specify what you want to lint and where to find your `.jshintrc` file.

```javascript
module.exports = function (grunt) {
  grunt.initConfig({
    jshint: {
      files: [
        "Gruntfile.js",
        "lib/**/*.js",
        "package.json",
        "test/**/*.js",
        ".jshintrc",
      ],
      options: {
        jshintrc: ".jshintrc",
      },
    },
  });

  grunt.loadNpmTasks("grunt-contrib-jshint");

  grunt.registerTask("build", ["jshint"]);
};
```

Now if you run `grunt build` your code will be linted according to the
preferences you specified in your `.jshintrc` file. It now becomes trivial to
run this on your Continuous Integration server. So something like [Travis][8]
can check pull requests are in line with your expectations before you have to
have a flame war debate about semicolons. You can also use watcher scripts to
lint your code as you develop, just as you would with tests.

## Conclusion

JavaScript is a beautiful soup that lets developers solve a single problem many
different ways and use many different styles. The permissive syntax means that
code can look completely different between two different developers. Arguments
will rage long into the night about the best way to solve a problem but at least
in terms of style this is something that should be respected. If I submit a pull
request to your project it should be invisible after merge. If you give me tools
to help validate that much the better.
