## What is the head command?

The `head` command is a command-line utility for outputting the first part of
files given to it via standard input. It writes results to standard output. By
default `head` returns the first ten lines of each file that it is given.

## How to view the first ten lines of a file

To view the first ten lines of a file pass the name of a file to the `head`
command. The first ten lines of the file will be printed to standard output.

```sh
head /usr/share/dict/words
A
a
AA
AAA
Aachen
aah
Aaliyah
Aaliyah's
aardvark
aardvark's
```

## How to limit the number of lines to show

To set the number of lines to show with `head` pass the `-n` option followed by
the number of lines to show.

```sh
head -n 1 /usr/share/dict/words
A
```

## How to limit the number of bytes to show

To limit the number of bytes shown with `head` pass the `-c` option. Instead of
limiting by number of lines this will limit by the number of bytes passed to the
`-c` option. In the following example the output is limited to 16 bytes.

```sh
head -c 16 /usr/share/dict/words
A
a
AA
AAA
Aache%
```

## How to show multiple files

To show the first ten lines of multiple files pass more than one filename to the
`head` command. This will output the first ten lines of each file to standard
output with a header indicating which file is being shown.

```sh
head /usr/share/dict/words /usr/share/dict/french
==> /usr/share/dict/words <==
A
a
AA
AAA
Aachen
aah
Aaliyah
Aaliyah's
aardvark
aardvark's
```

```sh
==> /usr/share/dict/french <==
ça
AAAI
abaissé
abaissa
abaissai
abaissaient
abaissais
abaissait
abaissant
abaissas
```

To suppress the header line pass the `-q` option. This can be useful to combine
files.

```sh
head -q /usr/share/dict/words /usr/share/dict/french
A
a
AA
AAA
Aachen
aah
Aaliyah
Aaliyah's
aardvark
aardvark's
ça
AAAI
abaissé
abaissa
abaissai
abaissaient
abaissais
abaissait
abaissant
abaissas
```

## How to use head with pipes

The `head` command can be piped to from other commands. In the following example
the output of the `ls` command is piped to `head` to only show the five most
recently modified files or folders.

```sh
ls -t /etc | head -n 5
ld.so.cache
ssh
pam.d
shadow
passwd
```
