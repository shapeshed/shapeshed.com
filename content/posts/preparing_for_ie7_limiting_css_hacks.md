## A sigh of relief

Developers everywhere will rejoice as code that appears correctly in every other
browser is now likely to display correctly in Internet Explorer 7. IE7 will be a
landmark release from Microsoft with a razor sharp rendering engine and
standards compliance (well mostly). If you haven't got it yet the [Release
Candidate 1][1] is now out.

## But there's a but

But pleasure does not come without pain. Way back in October 2005 Microsoft
outlined how existing hacks [would break sites][2] in Internet Explorer 7. The
following hacks will not work in Internet Explorer 7:

- html > body
- - html
- head:first-child + body
- head + body
- body > element

So the choice is now to avoid using these hacks or to deal with them when
clients phone up and ask why site layouts are broken. Or perhaps even to code
without using hacks at all?

Avoiding hacks is not easy but it isn't impossible. What's more you will reap
the dividends of passing seamlessly to IE7 once it is released.

## An example - The Box Model Hack

Probably one of the most common hacks is the box model hack. This is where IE5 /
Windows misinterprets the CSS1 spec by placing borders inside the specified
width. Faced with this problem many developers reach for one of the variants on
the [Box Model Hack][3]. Why not after all - it is quick and easy.

Very often however the Box Model Hack simply isn't necessary. If you need to
apply margins or padding most of the time you can apply it to elements within a
div and remain hack free

Look at this XHTML:

```html
<div id="content">
  <h3>Title</h3>
  <p>Paragraph</p>
</div>
```

If the content needs to be given a margin from the edge of the div then many
developers will apply margin and padding to the div. This will of course cause
problems in IE5/Win so it will be necessary to use a hack.

Providing you don't have to specify a width, you can avoid hacking by applying
the margin and border to the h3 and p tags removing the problem of hacking the
div entirely. This is just one example of how hacks are often used without
needing them.

Furthermore you can use [conditional comments][4] to keep your hacks for IE in
one external file. This means you can manage hacks more easily and not serve
these stylesheets to browsers that interpret things correctly. The example below
serves a stylesheets to IE6 and below but is ignored by non IE browsers:

```html
<!--[if lte IE 6]>
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="/css/ie6_and_below.css"
    type="text/css"
    media="screen"
  />
<![endif]-->
```

There is no doubt that at times hacks are unavoidable but with the arrival of
IE7 is important to consider how you are using them and to limit their use
wherever possible. Otherwise you may well find that your new best friend is your
worst enemy.
