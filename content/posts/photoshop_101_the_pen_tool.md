## A versatile tool

The Pen tool is great for adding details to graphics, drawing custom shapes and
sketching in general. It is a versatile tool that allows you a great deal of
control over the shapes you draw before, during and after you draw the line.

Learning what happens when you draw will help you to understand the tool. So
select the pen tool and let's dive in. Before we start I recommend that if you
are a beginner you turn on the rubber band option on. This will allow you to see
where the line is going to be placed before you draw it. There a picture below
of where you select this tool.

We are going to draw a curve. Create a document of 300 x 100. First watch the
video below and then I'll walk you through how to do it.

Select the pen tool and then click on the right hand starting point. Don't drag
just yet. This is the starting point of the path. You should see a small dark
square, known as an anchor point. Now click, hold and drag the mouse to the
left. You will see a line come out with a small square on the end. This is known
as a direction point. This defines the nature of the curve you are going to
draw. Then click another point in the middle of the page. A curve will be
created. Play around with this - the more you drag the line out the more
pronounced your curve will be. If you can grasp this then you are on your way to
understanding the pen tool. Click and drag again on the new anchor point and
repeat the process. Finally you need to close off the path. Hold down shift and
click on the corners to close off the path. You should end up with something
like this:

![Path Example][2]

## Editing paths after you have drawn them.

The great thing about paths drawn with the pen tool is that they are easy to
move around once you have drawn them. Using the Path and Direct Selection Tools
you can move anchor points and completely redefine the shape.

Using the pen tool you can also add in additional anchors points, remove anchor
points and move direction paths to alter the shape. The video below shows these
actions in order. Watch how you can alter the shape using these tools and then
remove the anchor point entirely.

## The joy of vectors

The great thing about the pen tool is that it is vector based. If you decide you
want to scale your shape after you have drawn it you can and it won't pixelate.
You can even make it a custom shape and have it on hand all the time. Once you
have drawn your shape click Edit > Custom Shape. Give your shape a name and it
will now be available for use with the Custom Shape Tool.

## A great tool

I use this tool all the time to give highlights to graphics, create shapes and
icons. It is well worth putting the time in to understand how the tool works as
you will find you use it more and more, and then you won't know how you ever
lived without it.
