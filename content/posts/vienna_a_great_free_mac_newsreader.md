[Newsfire][2] This looks really good and has a really good interface and
includes an integrated audio player for listening to Podcasts. That's all great
but I use iTunes for listening to Podcasts. Cost $17.99

[Safari][3] The Safari web browser now comes with RSS integration. After using
it for a while it is good but not really for me. Cost Free

[Newsgator][4] This would seem to be the market leader (I don't know this).
Apart from the logo this also looks like a great little client. It does
everything that Newsfire does and comes in at a still reasonable price. Cost
$29.95

[Vienna][5] This wins for me. A simple uncluttered interface and an in-built
browser make this a breeze. It does everything I want it to do allowing me to
read stories quickly and easily. It is like the RSS reader that Tiger never had.
What's more amazingly it is free. Cost Free.
