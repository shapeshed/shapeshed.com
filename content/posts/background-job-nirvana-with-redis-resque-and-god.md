## Resque

[Resque][5] is a Ruby library that lets you place jobs on queues and process
them later. It was created by [defunkt][4] and is in production use on
[Github][10]. The documentation is excellent. I'm using Resque on a Rails app
but it can be used with any Rack application.

First you need to install [Redis][7]. On OSX this is trivial with [homebrew][6]

```sh
brew install redis
```

If you installed Redis with homebrew it spits out some helpful information about
how to start Redis on boot or you can start the server with

```sh
redis-server
```

The installation notes for Resque are excellent so I won't repeat them here -
head over to the [README][8].

## Booting the GUI

Resque ships with an great GUI that lets you track jobs and workers. To launch
it from the root of your site run

```sh
resque-web
```

Then you'll probably want to spawn some workers

```sh
COUNT=5 QUEUE=* rake resque:workers
```

In the GUI you should now see 5 workers waiting to do your bidding

![Workers in the Resque GUI][9]

Now you can start sending jobs to Resque and watch your workers eat them up. The
GUI also provides a great way to review failures. The stack trace is even
included!

## Settings for production

There are a few issues to consider in production. Firstly if your Redis server
is used by other applications you might want to specify a namespace for the
application to use. You can do this by adding the following to an initialiser
after Redis is configured.

```ruby
Resque.Redis.namespace = "resque:YourApp"
```

As Redis supports running multiple databases on a server it may be possible to
specify which database to use but that wasn't a requirement for me. I couldn't
find anything in the documentation about this. If anyone knows anything about
this let me know and I'll update the post.

In production it will be important that Redis and the workers have high
availability. Redis can easily be configured to start on reboot but [God][2] can
also monitor a live system and restart Redis if necessary. God is another Ruby
based library for monitoring services on a server. The configuration files are
written with Ruby so it is easy to extend it to whatever you'd like. Using God
we can easily make sure our workers are well-managed and that if Redis does go
down it will be restarted. There is even an [example script][1] in Resque that
will get you started with managing workers.

With God running on the server we can be sure that Redis and our workers will
have high availability, or that we'll know about it quickly if not.

## General win

Adding a highly available and robust background queue to the application took
less than a day. Thanks to [defunkt][4] and [mojombo][3] for their excellent
open source libraries!
