pebble {code} is a pretty good candidate for using Recruitment Consultants. We
are working on some long term projects that are growing fast and it is likely
we’ll be adding further clients to our portfolio. For the vast majority of cases
we use our network, community sites like
[Stack Overflow](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/) or find people through our
own staff or peers. We have managed to find some great people this way. More
recently we have been using a few recruitment companies with very mixed results.

In discussions with recruitment consultants to date there is an initial spray
gun of words like ‘OO JavaScript’, 'Big Data’, 'Full Stack’. I’m often told that
someone is going to 'make my day’ or that 'I’m in luck’. We have given
Recruitment Companies a short, targeted brief of the type of person we are
looking for. I’d estimate that two thirds of the CVs I have read that have come
from Recruitment Consultants are not at all close to the skill set we are
looking for. There is little curation of candidates, and a sketchy understanding
of skill sets. I feel guilty but I am beginning to assume that recruitment
consultants don’t understand the industry well enough and are so busy chasing
commissions that they are not curating candidates as they should.

To be clear a service that I’m willing to pay good money for is

- A consultant that understands the market and skill sets
- A consultant that is proactive but knows when not to call
- A consultant that can curate candidates for my requirements
- A consultant that understands that reviewing code is as important as
  interviewing

The
[recent thread](http://lists.lrug.org/pipermail/chat-lrug.org/2012-September/008072.html)
on the [LRUG](http://lrug.org/) mailing list shows that many people in the
industry feel the same.

Perhaps I am naive in the thought that recruitment consultants should make the
process of recruiting some take less time than it would without them.
