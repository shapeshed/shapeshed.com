## So long Google Reader

The old news is that Google are canning Google Reader.

I take 'pouring all our energy into few products' as being Google+. So now I
dislike Google+ even more.

## Open protocols v Google APIs

HTTP is an amazing thing. Documents are scattered around the globe but can be
accessed from anywhere using a compatible client. A simple idea with massive
implications for freedom and humanity. The relationship between a content
producer and a content consumer is simple and elegant. It is direct. This has
disrupted many governments and industries that have historically relied on
brokers to handle information. What irks me about Google+ is that by pushing
content into a proprietary content platform the Internet suddenly becomes less
open and less interoperable.

Maybe I'm a 30 something developer reacting to the way the web is changing in
terms of consumers being spoon-fed content. But something in my gut says that
this is wrong for the most important thing that I value about the web: freedom.
I value that the architecture of the web is created on open, standardised
technologies. I value that HTML is easy to understand and works in many
different clients. I value that services can build on top of these technologies.
Google Reader did just this with RSS and HTTP, and left the data available for
people to consume in other ways.

Let's say I move my content production and consumption to Google+. I can no
longer use an open standard like RSS to interoperate with other services and
clients. I now have to use Google's client, rely on Google's APIs and their
interpretation of how data can be used. Syndication would be performed by a
proprietary platform with commercial interests rather than an open,
interoperable standard. Everyone but Google loses when this happens.

## Google+ needs to be more open

On his [Google+ page][2] Youatan Zunger reaches out to the frustrated Google
Reader users.

Here is my response.

- I value that RSS is an open standard.
- I value that as a content producer I can easily syndicate content to anyone
  with a compatible client (and there are lots).
- I value that as a consumer I can choose my RSS client.
- I value that as a content producer my relationship with readers is direct.
- I value that as a content consumer my relationship with producers is direct.
- I value that because of RSS my content is open to others and is distributed in
  places I had never imagined.
- I value that RSS uses open technologies and the Internet as the delivery
  mechanism for consumer and producers.

If Google+ embraced RSS or another open standard that supported syndicating
content outside of the platform it would be a less flawed platform.

## Conclusion

I don't want an extra layer between me and content producers and consumers. I
don't need a content platform. Because the content platform is the Internet. It
just so happens that Google is very good at indexing it.
