## Revealing previous states of images

If you are familiar with the brush tool and layers this will be simple. I am
going to artwork an image of a Kingfisher to bring out the colours of the
feathers. The original image was taken by [NatureatYourBackyard][1] over on
[Flickr][2].

In this example I am going to turn the image black and white and then bring the
kingfisher forward in colour. To turn the image black and white go to Image >
Adjustments > Channel Mixer. In the bottom right hand corner there is a checkbox
called Monochrome. Check this and the image will go black and white.

Open up the History pane by going to Window > History. You will see the last
item should be Channel Mixer. Now we are going to use the History Brush Tool to
bring the colour forward. Select the History Brush by hitting Y on the keyboard.
In the history panel we need to define which History Item we will be using to
paint with. Next to each history item is a small box. Click in the box and you
will see the history brush icon appear. Now you can paint back what was in that
layer.

In the example below you will see I have painted back in the colour for the
Kingfisher. I started with a wide brush and used a fine point brush to finish
the details and edges of the Kingfisher.
