![pebblecode on github](https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqw97kYnrf1qld9wg.jpg)

The dev team at pebble.it are proud to announce that we finally
[have a home on github](http://github.com/pebblecode)!

When we started the development arm of the business we stated that being an
active member of open source projects was one our goals. We also have a lot of
things that we think would be useful to others. We have used many, many open
source projects in our work so it is high time we started to give back.

Having a public account will allow us to publish our work and hopefully learn
from others in the process. We have plans to publish things like our default
Rails app, ruby scripts, puppet configuration, some work weâ€™ve been doing in F#,
our default CSS framework as well as miscellaneous shell scripts.

Hurray!
