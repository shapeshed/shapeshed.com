## What is the fc command?

The `fc` command is a command line utility for listing, editing and re-executing
commands previously entered into an interactive shell. The `fc` command is a
[shell builtin][3] meaning the command comes from the shell rather than the
operating system. As such `fc` can vary slightly depending on the shell being
used. The `fc` command is present is most shells including `bash`, `zsh` and
`ksh`. The `fc` command can be very useful for editing long commands entered
into a shell and re-executing them without having to rewrite the entire command.
The examples here are from the `zsh` shell.

## How to edit and re-executing the last command

To edit and run the last command entered into a shell run the `fc` command. This
will open a text editor and allow the command to be edited. When the file is
saved the command will be run. This can be very useful for editing and
re-executing complicated commands in a shell.

```sh
echo 'last command'
    last command
    fc
    ...file edited, string changed to 'hello'..
    echo 'hello'
    hello
```

The text editor invoked by `fc` can be specified firstly in the `FCEDIT`
environment variable. In the following example the `FCEDIT` environment variable
is set to `nano`. When the `fc` command is run the `nano` text editor will be
invoked. If `FCEDIT` is not set the `EDITOR` environment variable will be used.
After that the `vi` command will be used.

```sh
export FCEDIT=nano
    ls
    fc
```

## How to list previous commands

To list previous commands and not execute them pass the `-l` option. This will
show a list of commands run in the current interactive shell.

```sh
fc -l
    700  ip link set dev wlp3s0 down
    701  sudo ip link set dev wlp3s0 down
    702  ip a
    703  dmesg
    ...
```

To start from a specific command pass the number to `fc` along with the `-l`
option.

```sh
fc -l 600
    600  cat /etc/modules-load.d/bcwc-pcie.conf
    601  sudo reboot
    602  startx
    ...
```

To list a specific range of commands the first and last numbers may also be
passed.

```sh
fc -l 701 702
    701  sudo ip link set dev wlp3s0 down
    702  ip a
```

To suppress numbers in listings the `-n` can be used.

```sh
fc -ln 701 702
    sudo ip link set dev wlp3s0 down
    ip a
```

## How to edit and re-execute a previous command

To edit and re-execute a previous command first find the command to edit using
`fc -l`. Then pass the number to be edited and re-executed.

```sh
fc -l
    841 echo 'hello'
    842 echo 'world'
    fc 841
    echo 'hello'
    hello
```

## How to set the text editor dynamically

To set the text editor that is used to edit commands dynamically pass the editor
to be used to the `-e` option. In the following example the `pwd` command will
be edited in `vi`.

```sh
pwd
    fc -e vi
```

On saving the file the command will be run.

## How to view when commands were run

For the `zsh` shell it is possible to see when commands were run by passing the
`-d` option to show the timestamp for each command. In the following example the
`-l` options is also passed to only list commands.

```sh
fc -ld
    700  14:43  ip link set dev wlp3s0 down
    701  14:43  sudo ip link set dev wlp3s0 down
    702  14:43  ip a
```

A full timestamp may be shown with the `-f` option.

```sh
fc -lf
    700  9/28/2016 14:43  ip link set dev wlp3s0 down
    701  9/28/2016 14:43  sudo ip link set dev wlp3s0 down
    702  9/28/2016 14:43  ip a
```

For a European date format the `-E` option may be used.

```sh
    fc -lE
    fc -lE 700 702
    700  28.9.2016 14:43  ip link set dev wlp3s0 down
    701  28.9.2016 14:43  sudo ip link set dev wlp3s0 down
    702  28.9.2016 14:43  ip a
```

## How to re-execute a command without editing it

To re-execute a command without invoking an editor pass the `-e` option with a
dash. This will cause the command to be run immediately.

```sh
echo 'hello'
    hello
    fc -e -
    echo 'hello'
    hello

This can also accept a command number or a range of numbers from the history.
```

```sh
fc -l
    842  echo 'hello world'
    843  fc -e -
    844  echo 'hello'
    fc -e - 842
    echo 'hello world'
    hello
```
