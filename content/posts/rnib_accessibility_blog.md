For those who haven't found it yet the RNIB have launched
[a new Web Accessibility Blog](http://www.rnib.org.uk/wacblog/).\nThe
[RNIB](http://www.rnib.org.uk/) have pioneered accreditation for websites that
are accessible to partially sighted and blind users. Their
[Web Access centre](http://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/code/public_rnib008789.hcsp)
it is well worth a visit. There are plenty of resources avaialble to help
developers improve and test their sites and even achieve
[See It Right accreditation](http://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/publicwebsite/public_seeitrightaudit.hcsp).
The blog is another really positive step from the RNIB to help developers and
clients to understand the merits and application of Accessibility.
