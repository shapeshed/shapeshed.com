For those who haven't found it yet the RNIB have launched [a new Web Accessibility Blog](http://www.rnib.org.uk/wacblog/).\nThe [RNIB](http://www.rnib.org.uk/) have pioneered accreditation for websites that are accessible to partially sighted and blind users. Their [Web Access centre](http://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/code/public_rnib008789.hcsp) it is well worth a visit. There are plenty of resources avaialble to help developers improve and test their sites and even achieve [See It Right accreditation](http://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/publicwebsite/public_seeitrightaudit.hcsp). The blog is another really positive step from the RNIB to help developers and clients to understand the merits and application of Accessibility.
