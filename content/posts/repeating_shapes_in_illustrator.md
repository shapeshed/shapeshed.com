## The effect

Here's the effect we are after. It is simple with the shortcut.

![Spiral Final Effect][1]

First lets create a rectangle and fill it with the a gradient.

![Gradient][2]

For decorative effect I've added in a couple of motifs from the excellent free
brushes provided by [Bittbox.][3]

![Gradient with Brushes][4]

Now select the Spiral Tool. Select no fill and a white stroke of 1pt. Click and
hold to draw the spiral. Do not release the click (this is important). Holding
your first click and hold the ~ button (Tilde) ~. On a Mac it is located next to
the left shift button.

With the button depressed move your mouse around and you will see the shape
duplicating over and over. Mastering the effect takes a little practice but you
should be up and running in no time.

Watch the video below to see it in action.

## Tweaking the result

Personally I find all those lines a bit much. As each line it a separate path
you can call up the Layers panel and turn off paths to calm it down a bit.
Here's how mine ended up.

## Expanding the effect

This works with lots of other tools including all the tools within the rectangle
tool and line segment tool so get experimenting!
