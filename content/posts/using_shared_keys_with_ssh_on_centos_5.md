This tutorial assumes a basic knowledge of the Linux Command Line. The tutorial
is written for Centos 5.1 but is applicable to other distributions, although
file locations may be slightly different. The tutorial is targeted at Mac and
Linux users. Windows users can find resources [here][1]. The usual disclaimer

you do not know what you are doing please do not use this tutorial.

## What are shared keys?

Shared Keys consist of a Public and Private key and allow a remote machine to
authenticate a machine trying to connect it. The Private key resides on your
machine and is used to identify you against the public key which resides on the
machine you are trying to login to. You might think of it as a handshake. The
remote machine has a description of what to expect from the handshake. It is
unique to the client machine so if the handshake doesn't match then the
authentication will fail.

## Why use shared keys?

Shared keys have two main benefits. Firstly they allow you to turn off password
authentication. Malicious bots regularly crawl the web trying to login to
servers using SSH. They have large dictionaries of passwords and try to get into
your server using brute force attacks. You can limit this by having a strong
password and changing the port that you use to login to SSH with. You can also
completely turn off password authentication if you use shared keys. Shared keys
mean that no one can access your server without the shared key.

The second benefit is that if you use scripts to backup your server to another
one you do not need passwords to run the scripts. The scripts can just use the
shared keys to authenticate.

## How to do it

On my Mac I'm logged in as the user myuser. On the remote machine I also login
using the user myuser. On my Mac I open Terminal (you'll find this in
Applications > Utilities). First I need to generate the keys on my machine. I
run this command:

```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

You will be prompted for a password. If you don't want a password just hit
return. This means however that anyone who gets control of your machine will be
able to login to your server. This generates a public and a private key in a
hidden folder /Users/myuser/.ssh

It is possible that you won't be able to see hidden files on your Mac by
default. If this is the case you can enable this across your system by running
the commands

```sh
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE
killall Finder
```

Now on the remote machine login as your user using your normal password. In your
home directory (/home/myuser in this example) create a new folder and then a
file to hold your authorized keys.

```sh
mkdir .ssh
cd .ssh
touch authorized_keys
```

Now we copy the public key to the server using the scp command. This transfers
the file using SSH so is secure as no one can see it. You will be asked for your
regular password.

```sh
scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub myuser@7123.456.789.0:~/
```

Now SSH into your remote server in the standard way and in your home directory
(/home/myuser in this example) you will see the file id_rsa.pub. We want to
import this into our list of authorized keys so on the remote machine run this
command.

```sh
cat id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

This writes the contents of the key to our authorized keys list. Once you are
done we want to clean things up and set permissions on the files to ensure that
no one can else can use our key. On the remote machine:

```sh
rm id_rsa.pub
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

On the local machine

```sh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

You should now be set up to access your machine with your shared key. Login as
normal and if all goes to plan you will be granted access with your key. You can
debug logging in by adding the verbose flag to your SSH request.

```sh
ssh -v myuser@123.456.789.0
```

Once you are sure everything is ok you can now disable password logins for
addtional security. On the remote machine you will need root access and run the
following commands

```sh
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Find the line

```sh
PasswordAuthentication yes
```

Change this to no. Then hit escape : wq to save the file. Finally restart the
sshd daemon:

```sh
/etc/init.d/sshd restart
```

You will now only be able to login to your server using a shared key.
