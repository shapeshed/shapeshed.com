## Pacman and AUR

Arch's package manager Pacman is great. It makes it really easy to update and
manage packages that you have installed. Updating is as simple as

```sh
sudo pacman -Syu
```

Before too long you'll find that you want to install something from the Arch
User Repository. This allows community members to create and share PKGBUILD
files. It is also easy to [create your own][1] if whatever you want isn't
already in the AUR.

To work with packages from the AUR there are a few options to choose from. Many
go for [yaourt][2] but personally I prefer the more lightweight [cower][3].

## Managing updates

I'm interested in seeing what has been updated, particular for packages from
AUR. I run [dwm][4] and this allows you to set the contents of a status bar with
xsetroot. You can get the number of updates available for pacman and aur
installed packages with the following.

```sh
pacman -Qqu | wc -l
cower -u | wc -l
```

So you can use this in an .xinitrc file to set the status and check these values
every minute

```sh
while true; do
  PMUPDATES="$(pacman -Qqu | wc -l)"
  AURUPDATES="$(cower -u | wc -l)"
  xsetroot -name "$PMUPDATES $AURUPDATES $(date +"%F %R")"
  sleep 60
done &
exec dwm
```

Now whenever you want to you can glance up to the top right of the screen and
see if there are updates available.

Another alternative is to use `checkupdates`, one of the many useful helper
scripts bundled with pacman. For details, run

```sh
checkupdates -h
```

To see the full list of the helper scripts, run

```sh
pacman -Ql pacman | awk -F/ '/bin/ {print $4}'
```

## Cower

I really like cower. It does just enough. I like to review what has changed and
check PKGBUILD files before I install them. I took most of [Jason Ryan's][6]
[cowerd][7] script and have it in my PATH like this.

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh

cd $HOME/src && cower -d "$1"
builddir="$_"
cd "$builddir" && ${EDITOR:-vi} PKGBUILD
makepkg -si && cd - &>/dev/null
rm -Rf "$builddir"
```

To check what is available I run

```sh
cower -u
```

Then update with

```sh
cowerd [package name]
```

## Simple is good

Since I [moved over from Arch Linux][8] I've loved the simplicy that Arch, dwm
and other suckless tools have offered me. Pacman and cower make package
management a breeze.
