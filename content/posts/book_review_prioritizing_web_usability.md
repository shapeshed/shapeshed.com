### Usability anyone?

After publishing countless articles on Web Usability Jakob Neilsen is rightly
seen as one of the pioneers of making the web more usable and useful to everyday
life. He has conducted multiple studies into how people interact and use
websites across the globe. Furthermore he has published a large amount of that
information on his site [useit.com](http://www.useit.com/). Neilsen has already
published several books including
[](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Designing-Web-Usability-Practice-Simplicity/dp/156205810X)and
with his co-author Hoa Loranger this new book brings previous findings up to
date as well as introducing new many new usability issues.

### Usability as a philosophy

This books is as much about embracing usability as a philosophy as it is about
practical advice. Placing the user at the centre of design processes is probably
the most imporatant piece of advice in the book. Neilsen and Loranger state that
their advice is quite simple and straightforward. They also state that over and
over again websites are making the same mistakes. The idea that a website is a
task-driven space where users have a very short attention span is one that many
designers still need to realise. This book shows that embracing this philosophy
will stand websites in good stead.

### How the book works

The book works by going through various usability studies that Neilsen and
Loranger have completed. It applies the findings of those studies to screenshots
of websites. It is really easy to see the faults that the websites have made and
even better that the advice is on hand to rectify the usability faults. For the
majority of the time the advice is just good common sense but even an
experienced designer will probably learn something new from this book.

### Why this book is so good

The book is brilliant as it backs up advice and assumptions with empirical data.
The ideas are not ones that have come from Nielsen and Lorangers' heads. They
are observations of real world users doing real world task on real websites. For
this reason alone this book is a must read . This means the next time a client
asks why it is bad to have a pop up windows everywhere you can point to a study
that shows that users find it annoying. Absorbing the advice in this book will
only help designers and those commissioning websites to produce websites that
are more profitable and easier to use for everyone.
