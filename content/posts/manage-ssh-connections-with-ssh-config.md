## SSH Connections

If you are making anything on the web before long you will find yourself using
`SSH`. SSH allows you to connect to and work on remote servers.

```sh
ssh -p 8675 hercules@foo.com
```

## Using a SSH Config File

If you find yourself frequently running SSH commands you may get the urge to
create an [alias][5] for the command. In fact there is a better way to manage
SSH options using an SSH config file. This file can be located in your home
directory at `~/.ssh/config` or be made available system wide at
`/etc/ssh/ssh_config`. If the file does not exist you can create it and set the
correct permissions.

```sh
touch ~/.ssh/config
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/config.
```

For the simple example above we can create an entry in this file.

```sh
Host foo.com
  HostName foo.com
  Port 8675
  User hercules
```

This allows the following to be run and for the options to be automatically set.

```sh
ssh foo.com
```

## Setting an identity key

If you are using shared keys to login to SSH without having to use a password
you can declare the key in your SSH config. This can be useful if you are
connecting to different servers that have different shared keys.

```sh
Host foobar.com
    User horatio
    HostName foobar.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/foobar.key
```

## Setting defaults

You can set defaults for all SSH connections by declaring an entry at the bottom
of your config file.

```sh
Host *
     ForwardAgent no
     ForwardX11 no
     ForwardX11Trusted yes
     User shapeshed
     Port 22
     Protocol 2
```

## Debugging

To debug your setup run SSH in verbose mode to see the settings that are applied

```sh
ssh -v foobar.com
```

This will show which configuration settings are applied.

```sh
ssh -v foobar.com
OpenSSH_6.9p1, LibreSSL 2.1.8
debug1: Reading configuration data /Users/shapeshed/.ssh/config
debug1: /Users/shapeshed/.ssh/config line 5: Applying options for foobar.com
debug1: /Users/shapeshed/.ssh/config line 9: Applying options for *
debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config
debug1: /etc/ssh/ssh_config line 20: Applying options for *
debug1: /etc/ssh/ssh_config line 102: Applying options for *
debug1: Connecting to foobar.com [123.456.789.000] port 8675.
```

## Security

Personally I do not store my SSH config file in source control or in my
[dotfiles][1]. Effectively an SSH config file declares route into servers and
how to get into them so I recommend not making this information public.

## Conclusion

Using an SSH config file is another way that using UNIX can simplify your
workflow. For more I recommend reading the [man page][2].
