I was lucky enough to get a foot in the door at a web agency around four years
ago. It was there that I learnt about Web Standards, Accessibility and most of
the skills I use day to day. Time did conspire against me a little in that
during most of that time Javascript was simply a dirty word. The message was
that Javascript was bad for screen readers and accessibility in general and it
shouldn't be used. It also meant that my Javascript skills extended little
beyond alert('monkey');.

Picking up Jeremy Keith's book I was looking for a gentle introduction to
Javascript; one that wouldn't insult me, but that would guide me through a
relatively unfamiliar realm. Coming from CSS and XHTML I have a good
understanding of the DOM and was keen to see how I could apply that knowledge.
Happily I got exactly what I was looking for. Jeremy goes over the basics of
Javascript syntax first before using an example of an image gallery to show
Javascript and the DOM in action together. Once you understand how it all works
it is time to add the cherry of best practice on top. Graceful Degradation,
Progressive Enhancement and Unobtrusive Javascript are all introduced as
concepts and explained clearly and thoroughly.

This isn't a book that is going to fill the gaps in my Javascript skill set. But
it has given me a good grounding in the principles of Unobtrusive Javascript and
separating Structure, Style and Behaviour. I'd thoroughly recommend this book to
anyone looking to understand what you can do with the DOM and Javascript. It is
a well thought out book, clearly explained with some excellent practical
examples.
