If you are looking for a book that explains typography on th web then this book
is not for you. The Elements of Typographic Style is a thorough journey through
the past, present and future of Typography. It is a beast of a book and at times
a very detailed book on the intricacies of style. What it will offer to the
average Web Designer is a solid grounding in the principles of typography from
choosing a font to sensible rules that will create good typography.

Bringhurst's relationship to type is reassuringly humble. He explains that 'Good
Typography is like bread: ready to be admired, appraised and dissected before
being consumed.' At many times througout the book he likens typography to a
musician interpreting a musical score. One of the main pieces of advice is that
individual style should enhance and support the words rather than obscure them.

Reading the book will also help readers to understand just how limited
typography on the web is. With around ten safe fonts to choose from most sites
use the ame set of fonts and are often at the mercy of browsers as to how they
type is displayed. Using other fonts is often a complicated foray into
combinations of flash, javascript or non-search engine friendly images.

But Web Designers do have more control over text than they think they do. CSS
offers a large amount of control over text including size and positioning. This
book will serve as inspiration to explore these possibilities in greater detail
as well as recoginising the shortfalls of text on the web.

I thoroughly recommend this book as an exploration of typography. You will gain
a good grounding in the history and future of typographic design. You will also
see a master at work in Bringhurst. He writes with art, style and dedication. It
is a genuine joy to read (if at times a little heavy), seeing someone apply such
intelligence and clarity to his craft.
