Update: There are now [packages available][12] for OSX and Windows if you prefer
a one click install for Node.js and NPM. To install from source you probably
know what you are doing but this [article might help][13].

## Install Homebrew

[Homebrew][1] is the package manager that Apple forgot. Written in Ruby it
allows you to quickly and easily compile software on your Mac. Instructions for
installing Homebrew are in the [README][2] so I won't repeat them here. You will
need to install Developer Tools for Mac which you are installed as part of
[Xcode][3]. Xcode is available for free - it is a pretty hefty download but
you'll need it.

## Install Node.js via homebrew

Once Homebrew is installed you can go ahead and install Node.js

```sh
brew install node
```

Easy! Now create a file called server.js and paste in the example server code

```javascript
var http = require("http");
http
  .createServer(function (req, res) {
    res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });
    res.end("Hello World\n");
  })
  .listen(8124, "127.0.0.1");
console.log("Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8124/");
```

Save the file and from the console run

```sh
node server.js
```

Now you can visit http://127.0.0.1:8124/ with your favourite browser and you are
up and running with server side JavaScript.

At this point it is probably a good idea to consult the excellent [Node.js
documentation][4]. This will help you understand what Node.js is and what it can
do.

## Installing npm

npm is Node's package manager. It is now installed automatically with Node.js so
there is no need to do a separate installation.

If you are developing anything in Node.js there is a good chance there is
already a library to help you. It might be a module to connect to MySQL, a
templating library or a utility library.

You can search for modules like this

```sh
npm search [searchterm]
```

So to search for underscore do this

```sh
npm search underscore
```

There is also a [website for npm][14] where you can search for packages.

## Installing modules

Now we are set up we can install Node modules using npm. [Express][6] is a good
place to start - it is a Node framework inspired by [Sinatra][7].

```sh
npm install express
```

This provides a solid base to start developing with Node.js including [jade][8]
the haml inspired Node tempting engine. There is more [excellent
documentation][9] available for express too.

That's it - go create!
