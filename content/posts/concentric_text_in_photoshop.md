## Creating the concentric line

Please note this only works in Photoshop CS and above. If you are on an older
version of Photoshop this technique won't work.

To create a line for the text to follow we need to create a path for it. This is
where you will need to be handy with the pen tool but with a bit of practice it
is straightforward. First turn on Gridlines by going to View > Show > Grid. Then
select the Elipse Tool and draw three circles that you will use as a guide to
draw with. Make sure they are evenly spaced. The grid comes in handy here as you
can just click on a point, hold down shift and draw the circle.

## Following the curve

Then select the pen tool and in the options at the top make sure you have Path
selected and not shape layers. Begin drawing your path and try to follow the
edge of the circle as closely as possible. Don't worry if it isn't perfect as
you can come back at the end and fix it. Personally I don't like my line to be
precisely perfect but that is up to you. Once you have completed the path you
can use the Direct Selection tool and the Pen tool to move any points that you
are not happy with, or even create new ones. Here's what I ended up with.

## Adding in the text

Make sure the path is selected and then select the text tool. Hover over the
start of the Path and you will see the icon change. This means that the text
will follow the route of the path you have chosen. Then click and begin typing.
All of your text will have to be on one line and if the text is longer than the
space available it won't show. You can get round this by selecting all the text
and then reducing the font size.
