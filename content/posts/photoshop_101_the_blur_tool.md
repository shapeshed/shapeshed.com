The shortcut for the blur tool is R

## The Blur Tool

The Blur Tool does what it says on the tin - it blurs out sections of your photo
or artwork. For all of these tools you will need to select a brush that is
appropriate for the job you are going to do. You can manage the strength of the
blur with the strength option.

## The Sharpen Tool

The Sharpen Tool tightens up pixels that you select. The tool can be a little
crude so it is worth playing with the options. Again how much you sharpen can be
controlled with the strength dropdown.

## The Smudge Tool

The smudge tool takes a colour that you select and smudges it into wherever you
draw. It can be useful if you want to blur out the edges of photos, for action
shots for example. To do this sample the area you want to smudge and then use
the brush to fade out the edges. As it smudges it blends the colours around it
with the one you have selected.

## Tools in action

Watch the video below to see the blur and smudge in action. The photo is by
[Taosmax][1] and apparently he was hit in the face shortly after taking the
photo! What we are looking to do here is to blur out the background, then smudge
it to give it more action. The blur tool is a quick and dirty way of doing this.
