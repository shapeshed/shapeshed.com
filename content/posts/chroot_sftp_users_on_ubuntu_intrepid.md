## Usual warning

This article is written for Ubuntu Intrepid 8.10 and should work for Linux
distributions running OpenSSH 4.9 or greater. No responsibility is taken for
data loss. You know the score - take backups and try it out of a test server if
possible.

## Create an sftp group

First we need to create an sftp group. This group will hold users who we want to
chroot.

```sh
sudo groupadd sftp
```

This group is used in the ssh config file so in future we can easily add more
users if we want to.

## Create a user

Now we create a user that we want to have sftp access only. This user won't be
able to login on a standard ssh login but will be able to login using sftp to
transfer files. Replace user with whatever you wish. Set the home directory (in
this case /var/www/vhosts/theirsite.com) to the folder you want the user to have
access to.

```sh
sudo useradd -d /var/www/vhosts/theirsite.com user
```

Now set a password for the user:

```sh
sudo passwd user
```

Change the user's primary group to the sftp group we just created

```sh
sudo usermod -g sftp user
```

Then we need to set the user's shell to /bin/false

```sh
sudo usermod -s /bin/false user
```

## Configuring OpenSSH

Now we need to configure OpenSSH.

```sh
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Change the Subsystem:

```sh
#Subsystem sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server Subsystem sftp internal-sftp
```

At the bottom of the file add

```sh
Match group sftp X11Forwarding no ChrootDirectory %h AllowTcpForwarding no ForceCommand internal-sftp
```

## Correct permissions

OpenSSH is sensitive to permissions so you need to make sure permissions are
correct.

My vhost layout is:

```sh
theirsite.com
  - conf
  - logs
  - httpdocs
  - httpdocs
  - private
  - subdomains
```

The important thing here is that the folder theirsite.com must be owned by root
and in the root group. Providing you want to allow write access everything else
must be owned by the user and in the sftp group. You could of course set custom
permissions on sub-folders as you wish.

```sh
chown user:sftp -R theirsite.com chown root:root theirsite.com
```

In order for jailing to work correctly every folder above the theirsite.com
directory must also be owned by root and in the root group. In this case this
means the following folders.

```sh
- var
- www
- vhosts
```

If these folders are not owned by root and in the root group the user login will
fail.

So that's it the user should be able to login using sftp and you should have an
extensible chrooted SFTP system.
