It is easy to get into good practices that will lower the size of your CSS
files. You will save on bandwidth and increase the download speed of your site.

## Use CSS Shorthand

Using CSS shorthand can significantly lower the file size of you CSS size. Look
at the following two rules. They are both exactly the same.

```css
h1 {
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 12pt;
  line-height: 14pt;
  font-family: Helvetica;
  font-variant: normal;
  font-style: normal;
}

h1 {
  font: bold 12pt/14pt Helvetica;
}
```

You can use shorthand for the following:

- font
- margin
- padding
- border
- list-style

Browser support can be an issue with some legacy browsers so if you need to
support older browsers make sure you test thoroughly

## Universal selectors save on duplication

As different browsers apply different amounts of padding and margin to different
elements I find it useful to simply remove all padding and margin from every
element using the following rule:

```css
* {
  margin: 0px;
  padding: 0px;
}
```

This means that when you code your CSS you know where you are. Hopefully you
won't have to add extra rules for different browsers as all browsers will render
margins and borders as 0px unless you specify otherwise.

## Target HTML elements if you can

It is easy to get carried away with multiple classes. Where possible it is good
practice to start by defining rules for HTML elements. As you code your (x)HTML
you will find that you will save on the page weight of both your HTML and CSS
files. For example let's say that you want all h1 text to be Georgia. Rule one
is more efficient than rule two which also requires a class to be added to the
(X)HTML.

```css
h1 {
  font-family: Georgia;
}

.georgia-heading {
  font-family: Georgia;
}
```

Furthermore you will speed up your coding if you can use this approach
throughout your documents.

## Strip out unnecessary comments

Comments are important and you should not remove any comments that will help you
maintain the CSS over time. But often comments are left in unnecessarily. Before
you launch a site go through your CSS files and make sure there is nothing
unnecessary there. Also if you find section that you don't understand add a
comment that will help you in the future.

## Use a CSS optimiser

There are many tools that will help you to lower your CSS file significantly.
Most are based on [CSS Tidy][1], an open source CSS optimiser. This is a great
tool for cleaning up your CSS files and will often result in savings of up to
25%.

If you don't want know how to install CSS Tidy there are a number of online
variants:

- [CSS Optimiser][2]
- [CSS Cascading Style Sheet Optimiser][3]
- [CSS Formatter and Optimiser][4]

Caution should be used when running your CSS files through an optimiser. Often
cross browser issues can emerge and even rules can get mangled. If you are going
to use an automated optimiser make sure that you test thoroughly after
optimisation.

So here's to a leaner New Year for my belly and CSS files!
