## Using templates in Vim

The Vim philosophy encourages users to automate repeated actions and provides a
rich toolkit with great documentation to achieve that. One example of this type
of micro-optimisation is having a template or skeleton file that populates the
vim buffer when a new file is opened.

With just a few lines in the `~/.vimrc` file it is possible to build a rich
library of skeleton templates. There is no need to use a plugin and add a
dependency overhead to your Vim configuration.

## What is a skeleton file?

A skeleton file is a template to scaffold the creation of new files. This means
that whenever a new file is created a standard template is applied and applied
to the Vim buffer. For a `ruby` file for example, the template may be an empty
ruby class. The contents of the file are less important than the idea that for a
specific file extension like `.go` or `.js` Vim can populate a new file with the
contents of a template.

## Why use a skeleton file?

- It standardises an approach to writing a script
- It can include licence information
- It can be shared
- It can be managed in version control

## An example skeleton file

A simple example is a shell script. Shell scripts should start with a
[shebang][6] and often there is debate about the correct type of shebang for a
bash script. My personal preference is to use

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
```

To ensure that I remember to add this in a consistent way this is a perfect
candidate for a skeleton file.

The single line template is saved into `~/.vim/templates/skeleton.sh`. You may
wish to add license or usage information to this template.

## Populating new files

To use a skeleton template when creating a new file the following will populate
a new file with a `.sh` extension with the shell script template.

```vim
if has("autocmd")
  augroup templates
    autocmd BufNewFile *.sh 0r ~/.vim/templates/skeleton.sh
  augroup END
endif
```

This can be explained as

- An if statement checks that the vim installation has the [autocmd][2] feature.
- A [group][3] is created called `templates`.
- An autocmd is created to be run each time the "starting to edit a non-existent
  file" event happens ([BufNewFile][4]).
- If the file has a `.sh` extension read the contents of
  `~/.vim/templates/skeleton.sh` and inserted it at line 0.

## Populating files without an extension

Suppose that we have created a new bash script called `backup`. This will not
use the template as there is no `.sh` extension. Because Vim can read a file
from disk and write it into the buffer this is not a problem. In Vim simply read
the file into the buffer.

```vim
:read ~/.vim/templates/skeleton.sh
```

## Customise to your tastes

Vim's lightweight approach to templating is extremely flexible, comes with zero
dependencies and can be integrated into your [dotfiles][1]. It ensures
consistency of style either for your own scripts or can be used as part of a
standardised approach for a team.
