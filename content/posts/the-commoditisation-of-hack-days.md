## A chance to play

At their best hack days are a chance to connect with like-minded hackers (or
makers if you favour the modern parlance) and play. By playing I mean
experimentation, risk-taking and boundary pushing. Anyone that has attended a
hack day cannot fail to feel the creative force of passionate developers
striving to innovate. It is like an addictive soma lubricating everything with
the energy of progress.

## Failure is ok

> Try again. Fail again. Fail better.

<cite>- Samuel Beckett</cite>

Hack days should also foster the idea that it is ok to fail. Creativity and
innovation cannot happen without failure. Failure teaches much more than success
and I'd hold that creative projects very rarely succeed first time.

## Developers are creatives

I've always argued that developers are creatives. The average developer probably
has probably been involved with being a musician, a DJ, an artist, or some other
creative pursuit. They are progressives because they understand that the
Internet is changing everything and is perhaps the greatest creative platform of
our time.

Although the web is eroding management layers developers typically work for
someone else all day every day. For any creative a constant stream of delivery
is dangerous. The burn out rate for developers, particularly in poorly run
businesses with cretinous managers is high. In my career I'd estimate one
developer a year I know directly has hit burn out.

Hack days represent a creative transfusion that can re-energise a developer. By
stepping out of the constant stream of client or product delivery developers
have the opportunity to be free. No tickets, no deadlines, no managers standing
over them.

It is no surprise that in giving creatives the opportunity to play great things
can happen. Before the sun is up hack days have often created products or made
prototypes that can be used by millions.

Typically hack days end by teams or individuals showing each other what they
have done. It is an open, collective experience. There might be a winner, there
might not. Personally my enjoyment of hack days comes from the creative
adrenalin running through my veins every time I do one and seeing how other
creative brains work.

## Hack days and businesses

Businesses are realising the value of hack days, particularly around innovation.
The [business where I work][1] ran a successful hack day for a potential client
and despite some hesitation the [results were universally positive][2]. The
client was a full participant in the hack day and created as much anyone else.
One of the ideas from the hack day was taken forward by the client and a few
months later was released within the business.

From the client's perspective they got to see how the creative team worked -
fast, iterative, release early and often. In a short space of time they realised
around 8 ideas to tackle their problem. Developers were given carte blanche to
respond to the theme with no expectations. Broadly this experiment worked.

It was noted internally though that this was fundamentally changing the purpose
of a hack day from the chance to play to the chance to win new business. Clearly
this is a very fine line and instantly changes the dynamic of a hack day.

This week the business is holding an internal hack day and whilst the spirit of
play will be prevalent commercial concerns are creeping in.

> We want to create something that gets the widest possible audience.

So in one day it is inferred is that something with marketing relevance for the
business needs to be created.

## Hack days and corporations

Increasingly large corporations are sponsoring hack days and offering huge
prizes. Salesforce recently ran a [Hackathon][3] offering a prize of $1 million.
Salesforce clearly wanted developers to innovate on top of their APIs and
platforms and put serious cash up to incentivise developers to do so. Some
analysis is less forgiving about the motivation of corporates with these kind of
events:

> Corporate-sponsored hackathons are all-win for the sponsoring company. They
> get a big influx of fresh ideas, and developers working themselves to illness
> (not quite death, but a diet of soda and pizza, plus sleep deprivation and
> being sedentary for long periods is the definition of unhealthy), just to meet
> a crazy deadline. In return, the company puts up a couple prizes which is far
> far less than what it would cost them to get the same result in-house, paying
> developers fair wages, assuming they even have developers of the caliber that
> their hackathon might attract. On top of it all, it’s also a recruiting event
> for the company.

<cite>- [Alicia Liu][4]</cite>

The event attracted more controversy after the judging. The judging process was
entirely opaque and the winner emerged as a former Saleforce employee.

> I don't know about you but I'm annoyed that Thomas Kim CTO, UPSHOT was
> formerly an engineer at Salesforce for 9 years! #salesforcehack

<cite>- [@preillyme][5]</cite>

After accusations that the whole event was rigged Saleforce quickly [moved][7]
to award a [second $1 million][6] prize.

## What hack days offer corporations

Hack days offer corporations a massive pool of talented creatives. They have the
opportunity to throw their products (API's, hardware) at the very brains that
will make them a success. But it goes beyond that. Corporates can throw their
business problems at developers with a no win, no fee mentality. For developers
chasing a bounty they know the deal they are getting into but it fundamentally
changes the spirit of play and experimentation a hack day. It is no longer fun.
It is deadly serious.

Hackathons and hack days are everywhere now. Corporations from outside the
technology sector are running events. In January McDonalds will be running [a
hackathon event in London][8]. The event has some lofty aspirations.

> It’s time to build a better community. Together. In just 24 hours, you could
> change the way we interact at McDonald's

This event isn't really about community. It is about creating software to sell
more burgers, more quickly. The event features prizes and the chance to receive
'Incubation/mentorship with McDonald's Europe'. A cynic (and I will give
McDonald's a chance here) might argue that this is just product direction for
their business requirements.

Essentially this is one big product protyping session for Mcdonald's harnessing
developers' time and energy for a fraction of what they would pay an expensive
management consultancy to do the same job. We are long way away from the spirit
of play and creative freedom.

## Conclusion

Creativity has always sat cheek by jowel with business. Look at any major city
and you will find that innovative creativity is situated close to financial
centres. The creative hotbeds of Hoxton, Shorditch and Old Street in London are
just a short trip from the towering financial instituions in the City of London.
The relationship is symbiotic, necessary and eternal.

When I started participating in hack days there were no commercial concerns. If
there was a prize it was something trivial - champagne or simply the adulation
of your peers. Commercial concerns instantly change what a hack day is. It is no
longer the chance for an individual to take a creative holiday and play with
whatever they want without fear of failure. There is no rest from creative burn
out in this context.

As hacking becomes a commodity to be bought by businesses and corporations it
changes the idea of a hack day entirely. The freedom to experiment and play is
lost as huge prizes heap pressure on pizza-fuelled, sleep-deprived participants.
At worst it is a cynical way to exploit developers to solve business problems
and innovate for free.

Developers know they need time to remove themselves from the vacumn of client or
product work. As Hack Days become commoditised and more businesses and
corporations enter the space I just hope developers are savvy enough to know
what they are signing up for.
