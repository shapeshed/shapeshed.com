## Where am I?

ExpressionEngine [can serve 404 pages][1] but once the user reaches the 404 page
there isn't much to help them recover from the error. You could of place a
[simple search form][2] in the template but wouldn't it be quicker if we could
do it for the user?

## How it works

The plugin works by looking at the final segment of the 404 URI. For example
http://www.yourdomain.com/about-us/products might be an invalid address which
serves a 404 page. By using the plugin on your 404 templates ExpressionEngine
will look for pages matching "products". If a match is found it will be
suggested to the user. A simple usability improvement.

## Plugin and documentation

The plugin is available on [Google Code (ss-friendly-404 in Featured
Downoads)][3] and [documentation ][4]is available there. There is also a thread
on the [EE Forums][5].
