## Not very sexy but very useful

The Path and Selection tools are not going to give you a shiny reflection or a
eye pleasing gradient. But they will help you move and position things exactly
the way you want. If you use the Pen tool you will find yourself using this tool
heavily to move and manipulate the paths you have created.

## What is a path in Photoshop?

A path is a straight or curved shape. It is rather like a road - it can curve
one way or the other but it is always part of the same path. There are sections
in a path defined by anchor points.

A path can be open or closed, so either a straight line or a circle. Pretty much
any shape you draw is a path and can be changed or moved using the path
selection tools.

## The Path Selection Tool

The shortcut for these tools is 0

Using this tool you can move your path around and resize it if you wish. In the
toolbar you can select "Show Bounding Box" to show the box around the path. This
will let you enlarge or shrink it if you wish.

Lets have a look at a path that we have selected using the Direct Selection
Tool.

![Path Example][1]

When you select a path with the direct selection tool you will see the anchor
points and direction lines appear. If the anchor point is dark it means it is
selected and you can do things with it. The lines that come off the anchor
points are the direction points. If the anchor point is selected you can drag
the line to change the direction and nature of the path. Click and hold the
small square at the end of the direction line, known as the direction point.

Have a look at the short video to see the shape being moved and changed using
these tools. This shape was created using the Pen tool.

Particularly for adding fine details and fine tuning the paths you have drawn
this is an invaluable tool.
