## What is the pwd command in UNIX?

The `pwd` command is a command line utility for printing the current working
directory. It will print the full system path of the current working directory
to standard output. By default the `pwd` command ignores symlinks, although the
full physical path of a current directory can be shown with an option. The `pwd`
command is normally a shell builtin meaning it is part of the code that runs the
shell rather than an external executable.

## How to print the current working directory

To print the current working directory run the `pwd` command. The full path of
the current working directory will be printed to standard output.

```sh
pwd
/home/george
```

## How to avoid symlinks

To avoid symlinks pass the `-P` option. This will cause `pwd` to show the
physical location rather than a symlink. To demonstrate this the following
example shows a folder that is symlinked to another location. Without the `-P`
option the symlink is ignored. In the following example the folder `zsh` is a
symlink.

```sh
ls -la | grep -E '.zsh$'
lrwxrwxrwx    1 george users    25 Sep 15  2013 .zsh -> /home/george/dotfiles/zsh
```

Running `pwd` within the `zsh` folder does not show the symlink.

```sh
cd .zsh
pwd
/home/george/.zsh
```

Running `pwd` with the `-P` shows the physical location.

```sh
cd .zsh
pwd -P
/home/george/dotfiles/zsh
```

## pwd is normally a shell builtin

In most shells `pwd` is a [shell builtin][4]. This means the command is present
in the shell rather than calling an external program. This means that the code
will run significantly faster than calling an external executable.

```sh
which pwd
pwd: shell builtin command
```

Whilst most shells have `pwd` as a shell builtin the command also exists on
systems as an executable. On my own system the executable is located at
`/bin/pwd`.

```sh
/bin/pwd
/home/george/dotfiles/zsh
```

## How to reference pwd in shell scripts

In most shells the `$PWD` variable is available and is set each time a user or
in script changes directory. As such this variable can be referenced to show the
current working directory.

```sh
echo $PWD
/home/george
```

Although `$PWD` is ubiquitous it is specific to the shell running the command so
some prefer to reference the `pwd` command and store it in a variable. This
makes scripts more portable as they will call the system executable if the shell
builtin or the `$PWD` variable does not exist.

```sh
CWD=$(pwd)
echo $CWD
/home/george
```

Althought the `$PWD` variable is present is almost all shells it is possible it
may not be there. If you are really paranoid use `CWD=$(pwd)` but in most cases
`$PWD` will work.
