If you haven't heard of Jakob Nielsen you probably haven't looked very far on
the web. The godfather of usability has a [homepage](http://www.useit.com/) that
looks as thought he has only just discovered HTML. So why should we listen to a
man who can't really design a homepage himself?

### Common sense - worth $10,000

The answer is that Nielsen and Tahir deliver some brilliant advice. The reader
discovers that an audit normally costs $10,000 but it is easy to see how the
relatively obvious advice can have a profound impact on the value and usability
of a site.

### Wielding the axe

Nielsen and Tahir are not shy about pulling their punches in the Homepage
Guidelines. Out goes flash intros and 'musaq' (it must die apparently.) Out too
goes unnecessary graphics. Amongst the brilliant advice on layout, navigation
and copy this is the most contentious for me. Time and time again in the
examples that follow the advice, homepages are berated for making use of 'fancy
fonts', 'non-standard link colours' and 'over-compicated design'. It would seem
that amidst all the great advice Nielsen and Tahir would really just like things
to look the way they did ten years ago - where links were blue and graphics were
a luxury.

### Good design informs usability

Looking at the [useit.com](http://www.useit.com) homepage I can apply many of
the tools explained in the book. Who is the site for? What can I do on this
site? What does this company do? The answer to all of these is I don't know. On
first glance I would say the page is a local library where no one has the time
or inclination to go beyond the most basic HTML.

### A blend of both

Reading this book will give you some invaluable tips on how to improve
usability. I would argue though that you should combine the tips with a common
sense approach to design. Yes - don't overdo it, but well thought out design and
graphical elements can significantly enhance the usability of a site.

### Time for a redesign Jakob?

I'd like to suggest taht Nielsen looks around the web and sees some of the
excellent usable designs out there. I'd also like to suggest that he uses his
considerable brain to talk about usability and employs a designer to redesign
his local library-like homepage.
