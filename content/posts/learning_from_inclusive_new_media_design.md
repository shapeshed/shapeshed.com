## Not the same

Intellectually Disabled users are a broad and diverse group. Suggesting they are
a homogenous group is wrong. [Simon Evans][1] gave an excellent presentation
about the semantics of disability and showed that terms can vary depending on
location and nation. He also showed how disability is often complicated by a
combination of conditions, so people are not just intellectually disabled but
may have a number of conditions. Clinical definitions of disability are not
necessarily helpful in trying to create uniform recommendations as users are
simply very diverse in their capabilities. The fundamental point is that within
the definition of Intellectually Disabled abilities vary hugely. It is
important, as much as you can, to understand the group of users you are
designing for.

## Reading Ages

Reading Ages also vary hugely with Intellectually Disabled users but actually
practices that help able bodied users are also useful for Intellectually
Disabled users. Line-height and line length are important. Ensuring there is
adequate space between lines and that the line length is 9 - 12 words can help
ID users to read the page more easily. Font size should be slightly larger than
average and in my testing I found dark on light text worked best.

## Symbols

Symbols are an effective way for ID users to read and understand text.
[SymbolWorld][2] is an example of combining symbols and text to help users to
read. There are several different symbol libraries on offer. Advice given by
Simon Detheridge of SymbolWorld is that people who read symbols tend not to see
punctuation so keep one sentence on a line. Sentences running onto each other
are confusing. Too many symbols on a page is a problem so use small menus and
split content up into lots of small blocks.

## Audio

[Browsealoud][3] - was introduced as a product to read out websites to users.
This was shown to be very useful for ID users who may not be fully capable of
using screen readers. This product comes with a license fee so may be an issue
for projects with smaller budgets, although there are a number of open source
alternatives.

## User testing is key

Perhaps the key point that came out of the study for me was that user testing is
key. We had the opportunity to meet and test prototype sites with men and women
from [Ellingham Employment Services][4]. For me this was the point at which I
began to see and understand the issues. Some users were able to use keyboards
and engage with content heavy sites, whilst other responded more to sensory
stimulation. Seeing users actually using swtiches was illuminating. Working with
Alex Beech and [Lisa Haskel][5] we created an application to show users pictures
of their favourite things. If other users in the application liked the same
thing their picture was also shown and a connection was made. It was amazing to
see that face recoginition was a strong stimulus, and they loved making
connections and seeing pictures of things they liked.

## Users are not confident

A common point that came out of user testing is that users are not confident.
They are reticent about completing actions and if they do not succeed first time
they will feel that it is there fault and lose interest in the task. As such
user feedback is key both from the assistant if there is one and from the
website.

## Web standards are a good base

In discussions between the participants on the project a predictable conclusion
was that web standards are a good base from which to support users with
Intellectual Disabilities. Most professional designers and developers are now
using standards by default but it is worth mentioning anyway.

## More work to do

[WCAG 2.0][6] gives more guidance on Intellectual Disabilities but there is
still more work to do to understand how this user group can be given as much
access as possible to content available on the web. Disabilities can range from
mild to profound so it is difficult to say this is how you should build sites
for Intellectually Disabled users. But small things can make a big difference
and there are practices that can help all users.

## Conclusion

Meeting the men and women from [Ellingham][4] I really understood that behind
the term Intellectual Disability is a complex and broad range of conditions.
More importantly though there are people. Funny, enganging, and interesting
people. I met men and women with broadly the same requirements as able bodied
users. They want to be entertained, to connect, to access information quickly
and easily. As such building sites with good usability and web standards is a
good start. User testing is then the best way to test assumptions and gather
feedback from ID users, much in the same way as you would for able bodied users.

Finally creating sites that support ID users can be daunting in that there is a
huge amount to understand. Nick Weldin from [Paddington Arts][7] pointed out
that small things can make a huge difference and [Ann McMeekin][8] mentioned
that it should be a journey not a destination. In many ways recommendations are
in a similar position. What's clear though is that this user group can engage
with and get a huge amount from the internet. We should continue working hard to
ensure this happens.
