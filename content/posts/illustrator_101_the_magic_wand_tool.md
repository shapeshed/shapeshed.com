## Les Dawson - a great comedian

In this article I'm going to use a photograph of Les Dawson, a legendary British
comedian. For those of you who don't know him he had a deadpan delivery and
remains one of my favorites. In this example I placed (File > Place) the image
into my illustrator file and used the Photo High Fidelity option in Live Trace.
You will see below that the Live Trace does an amazing job of transforming the
Photography to a vector based image.

## How the tool works

The Magic Wand Tool works by selecting objects within your file that have the
same attributes as the one you first click. The attributes you can target are:

- Fill colour
- Stroke colour
- Fill and Stroke colour
- Stroke weight
- Opacity

In short this tool saves you time when you want to change the same attributes
throughout your illustrator file.

## Selecting highlights

Let's say we want to select the highlights in the image. By choosing the Magic
Wand tool we can target this. Click on the colour that you want to change and
all of the other colours in the image will also be selected. This can save
hours. Instead of going through the image and individually selecting each colour
you can do it with one click.

If you find that the wand selects too many different selections you can remove
selections by holding down ALT on Windows or Option on Mac and clicking. This is
a really useful feature allowing you to precisely target what you looking to
change.

## Customisation

You can also customise this tool to select exactly the objects you want to
target. To bring up the menu choose Window > Magic Wand. This will show you the
following menu:

![Magic Wand Options](/images/articles/magic_wand_options.jpg "Magic Wand Options")

You may need to click the flyout menu in the top right hand corner to see all of
these options.

Here you can customise the tool to select exactly what you are looking for.

### Fill color

If you select this the tool will choose colours that are close to the colour
your have selected. Use the tolerance option to specify how close the colour
should be to the one your select. If you choose 1 it will be exatly the colour
you select

### Stroke color

This will select all objects with a stroke colour similar to the one you select.
Again if you choose 1 it will be exactly the same. Don't forget that you can
combine criteria so if you select Fill Color and Stroke Color it will look for
both.

### Stroke weight

This matches objects with a stroke weight similar to the one you select.
Tolerance gives the tool leeway from your selection. If you click on a shape
with a 4px and you have stroke weight tolerance of 3px it will select all
objects of 3px and also shapes with strokes 3px either side of 4px so 1px to
7px.

### Opacity

This selects any object with the Opacity that you specify. You can set the
tolerance in percentage points. This will select other objects x% either side of
what you have selected.

### Blending mode

This selects objects based on the blending mode used. If you click on an object
with soft light then all other objects with soft light will be selected

The Magic Wand Tool allows quick global colour replacement and targeted
selection of objects within your document. Why bother selecting individual
objects when you can let the magic wand tool do it for you?
