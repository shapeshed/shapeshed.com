<a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/screen_resolution.html">One sentence</a> is bolded for extra weight : **'anyone who makes at least $50,000 per year ought to have at least 1600x1200 screen resolution.'**

OK Jakob! As soon as I earn that much I will put it in my contract!

He goes onto say that he expects screens to grow up to 5000 x 3000. The ratio of x to y on 5000 x 3000 is 1.6 as opposed to 1.3 of 800 x 600, so we are looking at longer screens. I'm not sure whether Nielsen knows what is coming but if he is right then it is going to have a big impact on designs.

What Neilsen doesn't mention is that with CSS we can give users more choice over layout. Max-width issues aside there is no reason why we can't switch seemlessly between fixed and liquid layouts. See [Simplebits][1] for example. This would allow users like Jakob (2048 x 1536) and my Mum (800 x 600) to choose how they see things. 

I'm a fan of Nielsen but I hope at some point he realises that the web doesn't need to look like it did in 1996. Check out [his site][2] - there is plenty of good stuff on there.
