<p>The dev team at pebble.it are proud to announce that we finally <a href="http://github.com/pebblecode">have a home on github</a>!</p>
<p>When we started the development arm of the business we stated that being an active member of open source projects was one our goals. We also have a lot of things that we think would be useful to others. We have used many, many open source projects in our work so it is high time we started to give back.</p>
<p>Having a public account will allow us to publish our work and hopefully learn from others in the process. We have plans to publish things like our default Rails app, ruby scripts, puppet configuration, some work we’ve been doing in F#, our default CSS framework as well as miscellaneous shell scripts.</p>
<p>Hurray!</p>
