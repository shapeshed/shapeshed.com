[Newsfire][2]  
This looks really good and has a really good interface and includes an integrated audio player for listening to Podcasts. That's all great but I use iTunes for listening to Podcasts. Cost $17.99

[Safari][3]  
The Safari web browser now comes with RSS integration. After using it for a while it is good but not really for me. Cost Free

[Newsgator][4]  
This would seem to be the market leader (I don't know this). Apart from the logo this also looks like a great little client. It does everything that Newsfire does and comes in at a still reasonable price. Cost $29.95

[Vienna][5]  
This wins for me. A simple uncluttered interface and an in-built browser make this a breeze. It does everything I want it to do allowing me to read stories quickly and easily. It is like the RSS reader that Tiger never had. What's more amazingly it is free. Cost Free.
