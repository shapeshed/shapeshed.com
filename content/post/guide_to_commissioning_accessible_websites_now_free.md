A while ago I wrote <a href="http://www.shapeshed.com/journal/a_worthwhile_accessibility_guide_for_clients/">an article</a> encouraging anyone commissioning a website to get hold of a publication by the <a href="http://www.drc-gb.org/">Disability Rights Commission</a>. 'PAS 78: A Guide To Good Practice In Commissioning Accessible Websites' is a comprehensive guide for anyone commissioning a website on what to look for and how to achieve compliance with the necessary laws.The great news is that this document is now free. It can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.drc-gb.org/library/website_accessibility_guide/pas_78.aspx">the DRC website</a>.
I thoroughly recommend that anyone involved in the industry should read this whether they are commissioning or developing websites.
