## Using templates in Vim

The Vim philosophy encourages users to automate repeated actions and provides a rich toolkit with great documentation to achieve that. One example of this type of micro-optimisation is having a template or skeleton file that populates the vim buffer when a new file is opened.

With just a few lines in the `~/.vimrc` file it is possible to build a rich library of skeleton templates. There is no need to use a plugin and add a dependency overhead to your Vim configuration.

## Why is a skeleton file?

A skeleton file is a template to scaffold the creation of new files. This means that whenever a new file is created a standard template is applied and applied to the Vim buffer. For a `ruby` file for example, the template may be an empty ruby class. The contents of the file are less important than the idea that for a specific file extension like `.go` or `.js` Vim can populate a new file with the contents of a template.

## Why use a skeleton file?

* It standardises an approach to writing a script
* It can include licence information
* It can be shared
* It can be managed in version control

## An example skeleton file

A simple example is a shell script. Shell scripts should start with a [shebang][6] and often there is debate about the correct type of shebang for a bash script. My personal preference is to use

    #!/usr/bin/env bash

To ensure that I remember to add this in a consistent way this is a perfect candidate for a skeleton file.

The single line template is saved into `~/.vim/templates/skeleton.sh`. You may wish to add license or usage information to this template.

## Populating new files

To use a skeleton template when creating a new file the following will populate a new file with a `.sh` extension with the shell script template.

    if has("autocmd")
      augroup templates
        autocmd BufNewFile *.sh 0r ~/.vim/templates/skeleton.sh
      augroup END
    endif

This can be explained as

* An if statement checks that the vim installation has the [autocmd][2] feature.
* A [group][3] is created called `templates`.
* An autocmd is created to be run each time the "starting to edit a non-existent file" event happens ([BufNewFile][4]).
* If the file has a `.sh` extension read the contents of `~/.vim/templates/skeleton.sh` and inserted it at line 0.

## Populating files without an extension

Suppose that we have created a new bash script called `backup`. This will not use the template as there is no `.sh` extension. Because Vim can read a file from disk and write it into the buffer this is not a problem. In Vim simply read the file into the buffer.

    :read ~/.vim/templates/skeleton.sh

### With just fzf installed

While we don't have to add any dependency, some of them do offer some great usability. [fzf][7] is a great example, its a fuzzy finder that you can insert any list to filter and it has integration with vim built-in.

The point here is that typing the hole path for the `read` command may get a little annoying. With the following lines you can just type `:LoadTemplate` and it will open fzf with all your templates for you to choose. Once you've selected the desired option a press of an <kbd>Enter</kbd> you load the template.

```viml
function! s:read_template_into_buffer(template)
  " has to be a function to avoid the extra space fzf#run insers otherwise
  execute '0r ~/.vim/templates/'.a:template
endfunction

command! -bang -nargs=* LoadTemplate call fzf#run({
      \   'source': 'ls -1 ~/.config/nvim/templates',
      \   'down': 20,
      \   'sink': function('<sid>read_template_into_buffer')
      \ })
```

As a side note, this is just the [fzf][7] binary, not the [fzf.vim][8].

## Customise to your tastes

Vim's lightweight approach to templating is extremely flexible, comes with zero dependencies and can be integrated into your [dotfiles][1]. It ensures consistency of style either for your own scripts or can be used as part of a standardised approach for a team.
